# TotalImagine.com Management

We need a place for dedicated non-content management notes! The goal is to avoid noise and make a conceptual disctinction between management notes/rought sketches and unfinished notes vs published contents. Also see: https://github.com/TotalImagine-com/TotalImagine.com/issues.

Notice this repo is still public.

## Dated Notes

### 20231125 Article

Tags: Idea

Two parts:

1. An article: When I die (suddenly), I wish the World to see what I have done and whst I have, but not everything, because there are pirated files and privacy concerns of others. Plus (Article content).
2. (In addition to the article) Github - When I Die: If I have a longevity lufe then clearly there are much more planning we could do, but it never hurts to plan for the unexpected - and I dont want the stuff I have done unnoticed by the world becaude everything is digital now and I can't expect 后人 to re-dosciver me like thet discover Davinci's 手稿. Tgere is simply no 手稿 to ve discovered.Here is what you can do to retrieve some of my most precious data. ¶I choose Github because it's free and certainly lasts longee than my personal website (Currently totalimagine.com) - maybe I should purchase the domain for some 100 years at once🤔
3. (Experimental) Train a custom LLM model mimicing my dialogue style.
