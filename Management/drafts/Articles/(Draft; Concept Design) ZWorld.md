# Current Progress

1. Consolidate notes from `E:\ZWorld Projects\ZWorldCreation\Game.World` to here.
	* Finish migrating and moving stuff to Other Games Person Portfolio article/repository e.g. "丛林冒险", penidng consolidating folder `E:\Software Practice Files (programming related, by framework, platform, engine and architecture)\`
2. Consolidate note from `E:\ZWorld Projects\ZWorldCreation\Dream.World` to here and Redream.

# Draft Notes and Outlines (Indexed)

1. (Management) The original intention of this article is to collect all notes from the old ZWorld folder tree, and collapse them into something more meaningful. Specifically, this happens when I was attempting to gather information for [Other Games](#) article while come across a folder like "E:\ZWorld Projects\ZWorldCreation\Game.World" - I will remove such hierachies once and for all. 
2. (Management) By all means, this article server as a **record of memory**.
	* (Remark) Notice some dates in this note might not be accurate due to multiple disk backup and migration, the modification/creation dates recorded by FS might not be the true date. Use only as reference.
3. (Management, Objective) By all means, this article intend to gather and elaborate and develope ideas, extract original thoughts, and make it referenciable for me and others. Provide useful information. Show some literature value.
4. (BookKeeping) There are some people who explicitly expressed their interest in playing my games (which I have forgotten): Anny (2014-04-09 12:07)
	* But there are naturally millions of more people who will necessarily be interested if I can make something good so I won't even bother record here including friends, family and strangers.
	* There also used to be people who might have shown intent/I have considered suitable for collaboration (which I have also forgotten) (Per 20131204): 张伟——软件编程; 朱雅雯——网络工程; 姚吉星：试玩游戏; 小赵：游戏背景; 易璐：我看很适合入伙。
5. (Record, Experience, Debug, Visual Studio) "Use English Path because sometimes VS canont recognize Chinese characters when compile" when I used to use deep folder hierarchies and seperate files for notes and migrate notes around.
6. (Idea) 游戏世界是无理的(2014-09-08 10:29)：规则存在。故事存在。但是游戏世界中的物质基础，我们不应该太严肃。一方面不给自己找麻烦，另一方面把握现实世界物质基础（瞎乱搞自己的物理世界规则没有意义）。另一方面游戏就是游戏。idea from：LOC。
	* Remark 20191206, MC: It's true only in the literal sense, and it's true only in so far as an incomplete "practical" utilitarism consideration. There are many objections on this idea, but let's just mention a few points: 1) Even from the literal sense, a rule, a physics, a reality can exist in a well-formulated game concept; 2) Fictional worlds can have their significance, just take a look at StarWars, StarCraft, Game of Thrones, etc. 3) Game mechanism is just one (small) aspect of a game - a game can also be considered/used/developed as an expressive medium, a piece of art, an illustration, an educational tool; 4) A game by itself can serve entertainment function; 5) The make, development, design of the game, and the process of it, all involve practical physical constraints - as an analogy there is a saying "one difference between naive programmer and professional software developer is the later knows how to manage its time" - time management, resource management, concept design, compromise, efficient high level modeling, those are all practical (and may it be more practical than watching TV) aspects of a game development; 6) Philosophically, if a game is a carrier of story, then it's not much different than the life itself, what's more, if it's a good story, it might achieve a sense of eternity life itself can never attain if it's ever finished; 7) Seriously what does it mean "game is just a game"? It sounds to me like "girl is just a girl it's not worth spending all that effort" or "it's just a dream/memory/trophy/compliment so that..." - that statement applies to anything and it sounds just like you were not capable of doing it well.
	* Remark 20191206: One thing I really lacked, is the **knowledge, experience, skill, assets** and maybe so called "professionalism" (which can contain many aspects), and more importantly **progress, achievement, setup**. In a sense, *"it doesn't matter how much you dreamed about, but how much you have **done**, and how much of that is **impressive**."*
7. (Game.World, Idea) 弓箭手（Per 20150226） 游戏名称：弓箭手；游戏类型：FPS；故事背景：精灵族；
	* 游戏描述/元素：发扬和描述弓箭的使用。	鼠标的控制来表达弓箭的方向和速度、力量。按住射击键之后锁定上下旋转但是横轴因为摄影机会晃动，只有鼠标走直线（鼠标不要水平位移）才能保准准度。弓箭根据品质有软硬之分。	箭矢是有不同的属性和效果的。
	* idea from: 三国争端，冷兵器之中剑矢为首。
	* Remark 20191206: 1) Lame idea; 2) I guess the original "idea" was more **distracted by graphics** rather than **gameplay** or **implementation** itself - notice a tendency to be distracted in those cases the *impression of the image*, rather than the *experience of play* - practically speaking if I would have possed a strong animation making skill, I might as well decided to create animation/movies instead of games - it's thus crucial to (Theory, Principle) disregard the visual aspects of a game and consider first the mechanism first, and consider the purpose/effect of game, before we consider the content itself (or otherwise let the game be content drive and less distracted by mechnism e.g. **A Plague Story**); 3) Do notice a central theme in early "game ideas" in terms of **lack of originality**: I was always trying to recreate things that *others have envisioned for us*, trying to *relive that experience in a game*.
8. (Dream.World, Statement) Per 201411082353：The Most important part of a dream is the way to apprach it.
To make it happen.\nAnd keep yourself and the dram, alive.\n\nLily, TI, Dream Scenes. Whisper, Project Jiu.\nAnd Learn Those Languages. We dont have an official Eng Name for 久层楼 yet.
	* **Remark** 20191206: Notice I have kept the "weird" original formatting of the note - that's an important feature of an earlier time - a way to build "atmosphere" rather than "content" by a younger mind. However it's not concise and sadly, it's kind of meaningless. One thing worth noting though, such pause have the melodical/literal value of introducing a  sense of lingering feeling.
	* Remark 20191206: We also had the statement "这个Dream.world指的是ZWorld中的Dream.World。并不完全指的是Dream.World（这个域名）。。。但是很明显笔记 《dream.world》就是在购买了Dream.world之后写下的。" - just never ever buy many domain names that we thought might be useful but **isn't yet** (e.g. ProjectNine, UnlimitedBattle).
		* Well, TotalImagine.com becomes useful years after I purchased it.
	* Remark: Notice also how in the past we used to "develop tools" a lot (e.g. note taking solutions) rather than working on **workflow** and actual **contents**. I think this *requires a shifto methodology and thinking* - and maybe that's due to a *lack of actual working epxerience and seeing people doing stuff in the industry*.

# Main Article

**ZWorld - A Concept**

(Just supposedly a very very short ~ consider it only 100 words ~ intro to my backgoround, and don't get distracted by the main purpose of this paragraph which will very likely turn into an article in itself, or maybe we shall summary it later or append it as an appendix) I have been **making games** since I was in grade 5 (when I was 11 years old) - using RPG Maker XP (for a more extensive memo on my experience and some remarks on game making at that younger time, see [Appendix A](#Appendix%20A)), craked version, while I was in China. Let's be fair, at that time, no consumer computer ran legal copies of software, including the operating system. I am deeply ashamed of that. Ever since then, my biggest ambition have been to create my own game - a real RPG game that allows people to travel around and collect items and feel as if it's real. My slogan at that time used to be (which sounds naive): "Give me a computer, and I will creat a whole world".

Here it bore a concept, a concpet that is unique to myself - **ZWorld**: a world created entirely be me. I used to call it a "concept", but practically it's more like an "idea", an idea that I will gather all my might to create such a thing, the details of which I don't know yet, and an idea that I will consider anything I shall make part of this "concept". Evidently ZWorld is a large thing, it includes all the games I have made, all the ideas I ever had, and all the projects I have provisioned. Specifically, during high school (after graduation from ICT, while I was back in China during 2012 summer), I classified ZWorld into **4 major genres**: ZWorld·Dream, ZWorld·Game, ZWorld·Reality, and one more genre I totally don't remember now. ZWorld·Dream includes all the dreams I ever had, all the dream journals I have recorded, and all the dream lands I have travelled and remember. During a later attempt I have moved that into a more concrete [Redream](https://totalimagine.com/Redream) project. ZWorld·Game contains many many things and I will attempt to summarize the experience in [Other Games](#) article. ZWorld·Reality is something I would like to keep it a secret now, but for the record, it concerns my behavior in the "real world".

## Appendix A - On Procedural Game Making

\[About fidelity, about similarity, about content and gameplay, about Unity vs Defold vs Xenko vs Unreal and in the end, about imagination - put this part into appendix: \] I call this "procedural game making", because it literally involves *no code writing* - but that's a very very understatement, judging from nowaday's experience. It is not programming in any traditional sense for sure - but what is *code writing*? If we shall consider Excel macros programming, then I don't see how calling stored procedurals provided by the (RPG Maker) engine, and perform conditional operations (and maybe loops, though less frequently) legitmatly "programming". I guess the major difference would be: am I writing in some *famous* hardcore programming language like C, C++, or am I writing in RGSS (Ruby Game Scripting System), high level human language, graphical programming (does UE4 Blueprint count as programming then?) or maybe Python?

## Appendix B - Used to Be Serious Concerns

It's curious we used to consider some things "important" and gave it serious thoughts, which tend out to matter after all not that much (in terms of helping us achieving some *useful ends*). Well, it's all **marketing**?

On Device (Per 20131219)
半路杀出个Avegant Glyph：
	超高清，1月22号开始预订(KickStarter)
	问题是不是FullyImmersive的：只有45%
http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/18/5222372/avegant-glyph-the-mainstream-virtual-reality-headset
The Glyph is coming later in 2014 — a Kickstarter campaign for preorders begins January 22nd. 
Worst case, Avegant hopes we'll buy them because they're great headphones（这个定义糟糕透了啊） — wild tech aside, the company imagines the Glyph will mostly be for listening. But eventually, maybe, we'll flip them down and see what happens. Confused onlookers be damned.
中国人搞的？
The device offers a separate WXGA (1,280x768-pixel resolution) image for each eye. basically twice the effective resolution of current Oculus Rift developer kits 这句话很有意思~那也就是没有优势了。。
http://reviews.cnet.com/wearable-tech/avegant-virtual-retinal-display/4505-34900_7-35828603.html
This means a crisp, clear image and, because of the nature of the projection's micromirror array, there's no screen door effect. Pixels seem to blend together seamlessly, creating an incredibly bright and vibrant image. 
 With Avegant's prototype there simply is no display. Your eyes completely relax and let the optics do the work of focusing. After staring at an LCD for hours, it's actually refreshing to gaze into this prototype.  这个对于虚拟现实技术的实现确实至关重要因为玩家可能需要长时间甚至超长时间的投入。另外考虑到该设备的特性仅仅用来取代计算机屏幕也是十分可取的。（和电子书比较，如果不在意分辨率问题）
Tang cites the phablet phenomenon as a sign that people want bigger, better displays to enjoy their content on when on the go. "Fully immersive virtual reality is really cool, but that's not something you're going to use while traveling or out of the home. We're trying to make something that you can wear comfortably for hours, that you can wear on an airplane... mostly because I want to watch movies on airplanes." 
Whether this follows in the footsteps of the Oculus Rift and becomes a crowdsourced darling largely depends on whether Avegant can make the product look good, make it cheap enough, and come up with a truly compelling use case.
试用和价格是必须考虑的因素。
which will be available to order on Kickstarter on January 22. But these goggles won't ship until "later in the year," and the starting price for this funky flip-down eye/headset is a lofty $499 -- not too terrible compared with the likes of Google Glass, but not exactly a casual investment. 

Oculus Rift优势：
	便宜和Fully Immersive

我们想要的：谁在乎便携性？我们要的就是惊人的视觉效果。那就是Fully Immersive（Oculus）和HD（Avegant Glyph）

自己搞起吧：

	http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/tidwell/ch7.html
——作为开发者我们有必要去了解原理。但是技术上的问题交给技术人员去解决就好了。我想把更多的时间放在一些有意思的事情上。这也就是说如果Oculus最终的4K版本足够好或者Glyph发行了130°视角的Display或者我钱足够多买both，那么就没有必要折腾这些玩意。该学习的学习，该玩的玩就好。不过Glyph作为显示器的替代品还是很可以考虑的虽然我希望分辨率更高些。因为我现在眼睛很不爽。
当然我们应该通过自然的方法来休息和调节。这也是为什么只需要Oculus就够了，因为我们要的是需要时Immersive的体验。别的利用现有的资源（电子书）来合理安排时间和用眼和老老实实学习。（毕竟根据Glyph的定义学习不会很方便的）
```

**Remark**: Nowadays I kind of "hate" new devices - they are distractive, expensive, and unhelpful in terms of creativity.
