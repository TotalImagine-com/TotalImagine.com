# Personal Experience and Collection Guideline

To achieve a consistent style, we need to determine what the style is, and specifically, the requirement for screening, designing, writing, implementing our articles. Articles are a place for us to reflect, at the same time research and learn, then we can produce references and further concepts for next time.

By the way the original motivation to push finish drafting this version of PP (personal portfolio) is so that we can publish it before finding a proper ECE496 partner, but it turns out this takes a *slightly longer* than expect, and I had found teammates before I finish this draft.

## Overview (The Functions) of Personal Portfolio

This **personal portfolio** is intended to serve **two** primary functions:

1. A **portal** of sharing personal knowledge and experience with the outside world;
2. A personal **reference handbook** containing invaluable materials.

Besides the primary functions, as something new and creative, the **postings** in the website (and the **development process** itself) is supposed to be **educative** and **inspirational** to myself. Being able to produce using **known skills** is _one major thing_, picking up **new information** along the way is _the minor other_.

As such forms follow intended functions, the visual styles (mostly **navigation** and intended **overall feeling)** and **content focus** is tuned towards **illuminative roles**.

The header images serve as a chance to explore abstract and concrete **graphics design** and practice ideas.

## Notes (on Post Making)

1. We need to try to avoid secondhand materials and focus on **primary experience**. For instance when talking about **subject A** we need information (reading) through **second-hand materials** B1, B2, B3,... which references or mentions **primary sources** C1, C2, C3,... - not until we have studied **Cs** thoroughly can we consider our remarks and thinking about A **original**.

## Publishing Notes

Some people to specifically notify:

* 不丑也要多读书：Recents, futures
* 孙隽雪：Redream, might be interested
* 黄欣欣: just want to share; Dreams all live can also mention (cautious very slow)
* 496 course: I already get a team, but I just wish to make some friends and talk about ideas. I am mostly interested in speech recognition related areas or outdoor activities. Please send me an email at charles@totalimagine.com.or visit my website totalimagine.com to learn more.
