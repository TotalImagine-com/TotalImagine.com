The first time it could be mistake or ignorance or whatever shit; At this time it may or may not indicate serious problem or as a pattern.
The second time it could be simple ignorance - not taking it seriously, or the first time wasn't very educational and we didn't propose any solutions; This time one must be serious and think about how to prevent or mediate things.
The third time it happens, one must: 1) Provide remodies immediately; 2) Cease any further and future engagements and be removed from the activity, though as humanely as possible.

In summary, the first time it's notified, the second time it's warned, the third time it's metiated and removed.

Following above rules there will not be a forth time; But if it shall occur, then it has developed a pattern - future actions shall be take accordingly, treating it as a habit/pattern/natural event and do not try to oppress it unnecessarily. That might be aptitude.

<!--(idea from, #20220826) The "stove top" incident - yes, apparently the stove top sucks, but I am thinking - ideally, and simplisitically, since this is the second occurence, I would directly cease using that particular stove top. But well, that is cool and everything, but slightly against human nature. Then I had this great inspiration: the first time it occured we might not have realized much, the second time it is the actual time it starts to feel serious, so one must be given a third chance. -->

(Example: UofT sucks by issue that "repeat probation" immediately, skipping "probation"; Though in the end we entered that repeat probation twice; And the third time, we graduate)

(Example: We deleted Iskra three times - that's one time too much; So we no longer talk)

# Technical Summary

Quote: Everyone should have three chances (on everything).

Applicable:

1. Learning: Fail twice is nothing; Fail thrice, find a new topic to learn.
2. Life: No punishment the first two times; The third time, there is no turning back.
3. Design work: If it doesn't work the third time, start a new one/direction; Ditch the old painting and restart from the beginning.
4. Software: Rewrite twice, the third implementation is the best.
