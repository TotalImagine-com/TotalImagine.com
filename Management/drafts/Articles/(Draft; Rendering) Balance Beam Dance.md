# Characters

1. We need at least a better real-scale main character
2. It would be nice to have three additional characters to fulfill the screen better: one fatter yellow shirt (like 飞屋环游记) boy sitting on the side foot in the water staring at others, one extra girl following the lead wearing a fancy color clothes, one slim and maybe handsome boy cross legged sitting on a balancing beam facing opposite direction to the dancing girls towards camera 

# Additions

1. Climb Stairs (Steel) like this: https://showyourvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Above-Ground-Swimming-Pool-Accessories.jpg
2. Wooden elegant plastic chair: https://aamcopoolservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/037.jpg
3. Gif animated water animation (and maybe hair animation) (and maybe wall hang decorations animation)
4. Seriously we need to replace water-tank interior material: https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cap-ferret.jpg

This scene describes a **low gravity environment (probably outer space?) game**, where one lead jumps and moves around the beams while others follow her exact move. Whoever fails to follow will fall to water and get out of the round. Fallen people wait at the side comparments until next round. It's adapted from a dream in...

The scene had **4 parts**: 1) the **main balance beams** which constitute the most of the cubical space; 2) the two **waiting areas** on the sides; 3) A **lower bay area** where the photo is taken; 4) The **entrance** at the top along with a small room for showering.

Notice the unusually long beams are *unlikely to have the necessary structural strength* to survivor in usually gravitational environments.

# Scene Construction

The **overall shape** of the scene is rather simple. **Texturing** is done on separate faces. Certain small objects needs modelling as well. [Current images](#) (4 set of new shots) as presented here is an improved version with better render quality. The original image had only the back of the dance lead who was only blocked out rather than with detailed shapes.

The scene was originally made with **Blender**, and later the dance lead was added using **Character Creator**.

The **water** is simply a plane with normal texture, it would be better to add some actual displacement.

The texturing is deliberately created without **wearing** or other time based effects, in order to create a clean raw render, this seems to represent a dream scene well. If this scene was in reality, considering it's environment I would add some details to the wooden area **underwater**, the rest are fine and could be maintained clean though some more casual objects might be helpful to shape the overall realism.

The overall modelling process, if I remember correctly, took around **10 hours**, the **lighting** and **rendering** took a bit effort because it's a completely interior scene and the refraction on the decorative  glasses on the side takes time. There is a large **area lamp** above the translucent ceiling so boosting samples is necessary. I don't need any fancy caustics effect because it's a rather well lit environment but besides that little can be done to optimize the rendering time **(is it true?)**.

I recall this scene is a (roughly) **70%** reconstruction/realization/materialization of the original dream. Anything outside the beams area are **partially reimagined**. For completeness it also lacks others **main characters**, though as a visual of environment I think it suffice.
