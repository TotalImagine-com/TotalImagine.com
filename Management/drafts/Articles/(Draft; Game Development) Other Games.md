# Other Games

Those are the games from an ealier time. I originally did not intend to put them on my website for one single reason - lack of **originality**. For all other contents I put on my website, I tried to make sure they are **original**, in terms of: 1) All **graphical contents** are completely designed and crafted by myself, or at least legally owned/layalty free/purchased/CC; 2) All contents are rather *complete* and self-contained, and ideally it should be *open-sourcable* meaning the contents are owned by me; 3) For graphic contents that are not made by me, they should not be the most part of the subject, but rather serve as decorative purpose as an integrated whole; 4) I wrote the code, or at least most of it.

However sometimes when I talk about my programming experience, especially about "game programming experience", some of my friends who have known me for a long time tends to criticize me for "not being able to produce as many results as I claim to start" - well that's an issue of an ever-evolving programmer and learner, but it does hurt feelings a bit. The point is, I do have some finished/semi-finished products, and even if some of the stuff I didn't completely finish, it might still cost some hard effort setting it up - graphics is always a hard part, especially for games, which can sometimes be graphics dominant.

It might still be worth mentioning though, even if some of the stuff are from a past time, and briefly talk about what I have learned from those experience.
