Fluent Synth: 

- [ ] Update project information to TotalImagine.com: We could talk about the design idea behind it - but can we put it into a WebAssembly and available online with embedde SoundFont? Try using NAudio in WebAssembly first, then MeltySynth, then FluentSynth. Then we can talk about it in our TI blog entry: core design ideas, from simple sin wave to notes, and easy experimentation with sounds.
- [ ] Practice with Fluent Music and author Thirteen Chapters of Night Wonder.
