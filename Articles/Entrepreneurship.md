# Start-up/Software/Entrepreneurship Ideas

<!-- PENDING CONSOLIDATING WITH MY.ALL PERSONAL NOTES; PENDING CONSOLIDATING WITH TELEGRAM ENTREPRENEURSHIP CHAT GROUP IDEAS; CONSIDER PUTTING ON GITHUB/GIST FOR EASIER MODIFICATIONS. -->

Some of those are collected from personal notes; Others might be unique per this article. Anyone is free to take those ideas; Attributions are welcome.

## Games

* MOSFET:SETI: For poor kinds like me who can't afford the space and money for electronics studies and when university education is kind of shitty and absolutely inadequate.
* RoboGo: Test the limit of modern real-time combat.

## Productivity

* (2023) Markdown should really support: 1) Pop-up/Embedded multi-line payloads, 2) Images, and multimedia contents. This is for self-contained management.
* (2023) GitHub Pages needs better ways to managem multi-media, e.g. self-hosted images.

## Industries

## Programs

## Hardware

* (2023) Recorder with basic editing and on-demand usage functionalities: One will be surprised how barren this market (in terms of supply?) is, and existing mobile apps just doesn't justify the needs. A proper recorder should be able to: 1) Run on demand, 2) Allow insertion, 3) Allow deletion. And ideally those are achieved with physical buttons. I don't see the need for wifi support, but being able to write directly to SD cards is a must.

## Non-Centralized Applications

* Ethereum Lottery: Real-world lotteries are not trustworthy. Programmed in [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity), participants are guaranteed a transparent process. No one is there to take our winning money as tax. Idea courtesy of Shawn Li.
* Ethereum Central Ledger: When implemented, it can serve as a fund for apps like [SeekingMate](https://github.com/SeekingMate).

## Online Services

* (2023) Anonymous Free Social Online Surveys (with demographical identification information upon registration) for social studies, personal FAQ, and market research. The website should be something like Stackoverflows and be easily accessible and free-to-use, and offers among other things most importantly: registration and personal social identity information editing, survey publication and editing, interest editing, and participated surveys page. A person can see survey results after participation. Any new survey should ideally do a search to avoid repeating the same kind of questions. Each survey is versioned and new edits must record new polls and cannot directly inherit older polls. No comments shall be provided, but survey publisher can describe survey goals and purpose.

## Solution

* (2022) (Business Automation) Needs a visual-driven node-based process automation framework. Kind of [WWF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/). Partially implemented in [Parcel](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Parcel) and https://charles-zhang.itch.io/expressoExpresso, also as a core concept in [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core). Pending a dedicated article on this concept. Alternative workflow uses Python/Jupyter Notebook, or [Pure](https://github.com/Pure-The-Language).
* (2022) (Business Analytics) Needs a better programmable business analytics platform, ideally incorporating dbt like processing workflow and as one-stop ETL/ELT solution, as an alternative to [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). PowerBI generally is the best but there are lots of issue with its programmability, lack of open-source nature, and very troublesome GUI (too many clicks).

## Social Media

* (2023) On the problem of mating: [Github](https://github.com/SeekingMate)

### 20230802 Multi-layer Graph

Tags: Software, Platform, Note-taking, Productivity

Had this idea for a while. Basically it's either a node-graph or something like Draw.IO, but the organization scheme is that you can keep "drill-down" and go deeper. Will be immensely powerful, no idea why it's not already done. A clean interface is also the key. Parcel kind of was moving in that direction but I never got chance to complete it.
