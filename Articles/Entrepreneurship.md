<!-- PENDING CONSOLIDATING WITH MY.ALL PERSONAL NOTES; PENDING CONSOLIDATING WITH TELEGRAM ENTREPRENEURSHIP CHAT GROUP IDEAS; CONSIDER PUTTING ON GITHUB/GIST FOR EASIER MODIFICATIONS. -->

Some of those are collected from personal notes; Others might be unique per this article.

## Productivity

* (2023) Markdown should really support: 1) Pop-up/Embedded multi-line payloads, 2) Images, and multimedia contents. This is for self-contained management.
* (2023) GitHub Pages needs better ways to managem multi-media, e.g. self-hosted images.

## Industries

## Programs

## Hardware

## Solution

* (2022) (Business Automation) Needs a visual-driven node-based process automation framework. Kind of [WWF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/). Partially implemented in [Parcel](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Parcel) and https://charles-zhang.itch.io/expressoExpresso, also as a core concept in [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core). Pending a dedicated article on this concept. Alternative workflow uses Python/Jupyter Notebook, or [Pure](https://github.com/Pure-The-Language).
* (2022) Needs a better programmable business analytics platform, ideally incorporating dbt like processing workflow and as one-stop ETL/ELT solution, as an alternative to [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

Had this idea for a while. Basically it's either a node-graph or something like Draw.IO, but the organization scheme is that you can keep "drill-down" and go deeper. Will be immensely powerful, no idea why it's not already done. A clean interface is also the key. Parcel kind of was moving in that direction but I never got chance to complete it.
