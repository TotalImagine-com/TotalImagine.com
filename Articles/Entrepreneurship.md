<!-- PENDING CONSOLIDATING WITH MY.ALL PERSONAL NOTES; PENDING CONSOLIDATING WITH TELEGRAM ENTREPRENEURSHIP CHAT GROUP IDEAS; CONSIDER PUTTING ON GITHUB/GIST FOR EASIER MODIFICATIONS. -->

Some of those are collected from personal notes; Others might be unique per this article. Anyone is free to take those ideas; Attributions are welcome.

## Entertainment

* (2023) (Experience) The iPad Experience: Dark room LiDAR, Aquarium, mystical jungle, haunted house treasure hunt.
* (2023) (Virtual Tour Service) (Empty Industry Room) Virtual AR/VR Tour: Just need a large walkable space - but Is this kind of pixel streaming better than VR?
* (2023) (Virtual Tour Service) Basically you pay money and let others travel for you. There are two forms: 1-1 travel where you can dictate and save yourself the travel to fly; Virtual Tour, but 给钱，让人去旅游。That's the fun.

## Games

* MOSFET:SETI: For poor kinds like me who can't afford the space and money for electronics studies and when university education is kind of shitty and absolutely inadequate.
* RoboGo: Test the limit of modern real-time combat.
* Dream of Red Chamber (a re-interpretation) (not an original recreation of plots): 红楼梦Gal game攻略妹妹 (idea from) Mentioned a few times by Ashley, and I think it's a cool idea. As a simple starter, it could be a 2D visual novel-like, or even a traditional non-novel hentai 恋爱 game.

## Productivity

* (2023) Markdown should really support: 1) Pop-up/Embedded multi-line payloads, 2) Images, and multimedia contents. This is for self-contained management.
* (2023) GitHub Pages needs better ways to managem multi-media, e.g. self-hosted images.

## Industries

## Programs

## Hardware

* (2023) Recorder with basic editing and on-demand usage functionalities: One will be surprised how barren this market (in terms of supply?) is, and existing mobile apps just doesn't justify the needs. A proper recorder should be able to: 1) Run on demand, 2) Allow insertion, 3) Allow deletion. And ideally those are achieved with physical buttons. I don't see the need for wifi support, but being able to write directly to SD cards is a must.
* (2022, 2023) Precise Head Position Tracking for AR: May use base stations.

## Non-Centralized Applications

* Ethereum Lottery: Decentralized blockchain-based lottery. Real-world lotteries are not trustworthy. Programmed in [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity), participants are guaranteed a transparent process. No one is there to take our winning money as tax. Idea courtesy of Shawn Li.
* Ethereum Central Ledger (Fund): When implemented, it can serve as a fund for apps like [SeekingMate](https://github.com/SeekingMate).

## YouTube Video Production Series

* Emily & James: Dedicated animation shots.
* Studying Unreal Engine Source Code: Just official documentation and official source code, digging through walkthrough - something I wanted existed when learning for myself.
* World Build for Project Nine: Talk about specific aspects from technical, theoratical and how-to-with-tools perspectives. Sharing and consolidation of knowledge.
* Studying PyTorch Source Code: Always wanted to write deep learning, also review math.

## Online Services

* (2021/2022) iAvatar: Fashion, and virtual character and having luxury presentation. Partly inspired by Mopcat/catface or whatever UofT makeup idea by signal and processing professor.
* (2023) Anonymous Free Social Online Surveys (with demographical identification information upon registration) for social studies, personal FAQ, and market research. The website should be something like Stackoverflows and be easily accessible and free-to-use, and offers among other things most importantly: registration and personal social identity information editing, survey publication and editing, interest editing, and participated surveys page. A person can see survey results after participation. Any new survey should ideally do a search to avoid repeating the same kind of questions. Each survey is versioned and new edits must record new polls and cannot directly inherit older polls. No comments shall be provided, but survey publisher can describe survey goals and purpose.

## Productivity

* (2022, 2023) A new file format that can be previewed in windows and most importantly - supports rich metadata and notes and tags. To implement it on windows is fairly easy, we can just create a specialized ZIP that contains an image file and a text file or some other stuff, and most importantly, write a proper Win32 Shell extension to allow previewing the image itself, and add to properties that allows reading and editing the metadata (or we could develop external tools for managing that). Alternatively, we figure out how realiable is DigiKam (at the moment we don't like it because it's monolithic and configuration is a bit confusing and I don't know how reliable it is in associating data with files, especially when we edit photos in Windows Explorer; And the interface is a bit hard to use when editing tags and notes). Alternatively, we could enhance [Somewhere](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Somewhere/Somewhere) to allow it tracking file changes properly, like DigiKam or Everything does.

## Solution

* (2022) (Business Automation) Needs a visual-driven node-based process automation framework. Kind of [WWF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/). Partially implemented in [Parcel](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Parcel) and https://charles-zhang.itch.io/expressoExpresso, also as a core concept in [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core). Pending a dedicated article on this concept. Alternative workflow uses Python/Jupyter Notebook, or [Pure](https://github.com/Pure-The-Language).
* (2022) (Business Analytics) Needs a better programmable business analytics platform, ideally incorporating dbt like processing workflow and as one-stop ETL/ELT solution, as an alternative to [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). PowerBI generally is the best but there are lots of issue with its programmability, lack of open-source nature, and very troublesome GUI (too many clicks).

## Software

* (2019, 2022) Spreadsheet: Object-oriented, functional programmable spreadsheet application. Partly implemented in [Parcel](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Parcel) - but we actually want a GUI interface that's much just like Excel. The core problem we try to solve is to enable named variables and named table ranges and enforce strongly-typed and safe references. For GUI framework, we should clearly use Qt.

## Social Media

* (2023) On the problem of mating: [Github](https://github.com/SeekingMate)

## Theme Park

* (2023) Life/Survival Simulator: See 20231006 dream.

## Personal Business Endavours

Personal because it's personal and only I can do it.

* (Magazine) The Project Nine Magazine (Entertainment Industry): Magazine with a vision.
* (Technology) Dreamscape (Technology Industry): Dreamscape with a vision.

### 20230802 Multi-layer Graph

Tags: Software, Platform, Note-taking, Productivity

Had this idea for a while. Basically it's either a node-graph or something like Draw.IO, but the organization scheme is that you can keep "drill-down" and go deeper. Will be immensely powerful, no idea why it's not already done. A clean interface is also the key. Parcel kind of was moving in that direction but I never got chance to complete it.
