## LC - A lucid dream within a dream.: Have you ever (judged) wrong (about whether you are dreaming)?

Tags: Lucid Dream, School

4:43

Funny, was talking with Ryan/Savana/Ray last night about it and I had it.

(Recording using a laptop helps a lot; Started with phone then switched to laptop for easier formatting and longer details; Also saved my finger from feeling uncomfortable)
Mostly recorded some contexts, and the actual LC part didn't got much detail.

Way before everything I was studying or chatting with friends/classmates in our old 竹山路 retail store like environment, when I moved to second floor, and saw Louis sick and was not listening to me and joked about telling his father to tell him to go home. A guy was fully naked then I realized she's wearing some female garments on her upper body and it's a girl with a small dick. She said she doesn't want to get sick from others' COVID symptoms so she took her clothes off.

There were some 2-4 other classmates (some original). Notably I might have seen 梁辉 as well (he's in my dreams a lot). Then there was this errand where we need to help move some stuff to upper offices (some 4th floor) and the office is such a crowded storage space we had difficulty finding a place standing. At that time there was also a stranger from another class/school and I told him to hide behind the door so if the teacher comes up to inspect they won't notice - but even if they do see us, our suspecion was that the teacher knows no one from our class so she might recognize there was someone else in our group.

There might be something else going on because I wanted to stay in that office talking to some classmate about a topic we didn't finish in the classroom.

I was thinking of telling louis' father and how effective that would me - would that make me feel like a 小人 or it's actually a good strategy (because he may or may not listen for his parents are in Hangzhou, but they may still have remote influence over him here) for everyone when I fell asleep there.

After I woke up I tried to turn on the light and after turn on the switch on the wall the light wasn't lit on the ceiling. And that prompted me I was dreaming. It's dark and my vision is very blurry (like sleepy and couldn't open my eyelid), even if I try very hard to see. I did the usual trick - biting the second 关节 of my index finger and it was rubber like. So I knew it was a dream.

I tried a few times (like 3-4 times) to do something - turn on the light, find a place to escape that room, and felt too tired and fell asleep again, and after quickly woke up and tried to turn the switch and it's still dark and tried to bite the finger and it's still rubber like. I doubted briefly whether I was just too sleepy (like had a very good afternoon nap in a comfortable bed and very sleepy afterwards when woke up prematurely by alarm clock) (by the way the strategy in those circumstances is to sleep less than 25min and sleep in an unusual bed position) or it's actually in a dream.

Even at this time our sighs are very blurry - no sense of sudden lucidity at all. It's just firm belief based on my (professonal😂) experience and I know I am dreaming and I need to do something (didn't think of my primary goal due to lack of practice those days: go to the moon).
The windows are NOT openable and has those metal bars outside it, I jumped onto it and it's rubbery and can stretch a bit.

There were momentary doubts but experience told us it's dream and we carried on, forgetting I was in the office before (so if it were a dream and I am still in the office, then that must be part of the dream).

Finally I tried really hard kocking on the fenced window and it stretched more than 2 meters without breaking and I suddenly popped onto the other side of the window - and didn't manage to fly. I fell straight on the the ground. It's like a few floors high and despite the speed, the landing is like a cotton ball - I just stick to the ground and didn't bounce off and can walk around freely now, not feeling any pain (of course). And I was certain now I am in control of my dream (not realizing it's still at the school!) My vision is very clear now.

Funny dresses and interesting motorcycles. Like rebels, weird people on campus streets. Thought of sex, but removed the idea because don't want to wake up.

The entire duration of the lucid dream wasn't much. Like at most 1.5 minutes. I was just walking around and saw in sequence 4-5 distinct people. I have this superpower now that if someone charges at me on her motorcycle, I can just jump away before it hits me. There were those 1 or 2 guys riding in cycle and always trying to hit me - for fun, and I wasn't offended and was playing along. Besides that, the environment was an ordinary (though someone nicely planned campus) with building far apart and nothing special in terms or architecture otherwise - it's those people that's out of place and shouldn't appear in a campus and feels like they are on a parad.

Gradually it does. Then we saw somehow principle and headmaster walk by the administration building and saw light on second floor was on and thetr was a jump in time, and we were in talking with principle.

In the room I was lying on the floor, and some items (like water bottles) I brought with me are on the floor as well, and the windows are open - like someone struggled to get up. Like I dream walked. That gives me 30% doubt what if I did jump out of the window?

I was about to tell him I felt classes were boring so I needed to try to get an LC. Then I woke up. Now I think about it, I probably went there to talk with someone. It's also at this moment I thought "have you ever wrong" and told him I want to take a last note. He said do it quick for he doesn't want to wait for me to explain to him - it's surprisingly generous already. If it were China (we were all speaking English) then those school officers must all be very mad and angry and shouting for no reason (or just because they think they are prestigous over students).

In general this dream has lots of shifts of environments and small modificaions of (larger contextual) environment that I didn't notice at that time.

## LC - 一场梦中的清醒梦：你曾经（判断）错了吗（关于你是否在做梦）？

标签：清醒梦

4:43

有趣的是，昨晚和Ryan/Savana/Ray谈论了这个，然后我就经历了它。

（使用笔记本电脑录音很有帮助；一开始是用手机，后来切换到笔记本电脑，便于格式化和提供更多细节，也避免了手指感到不舒服）
大部分时间记录了一些背景信息，实际的清醒梦部分没有太多细节。

在一切之前，我正在我们以前的竹山路零售店环境中学习或与朋友/同学聊天，当我搬到二楼时，看到Louis生病了，不听我的话，并取笑说要告诉他爸爸叫他回家。一个男的完全裸着，然后我意识到她上半身穿着一些女性的衣物，是个带小JJ的女孩。她说她不想因为别人的COVID症状而生病，所以她脱掉了衣服。

有2-4个其他同学（一些原班人马）。值得注意的是，我可能也看到了梁辉（他经常出现在我的梦中）。然后有一个差事，我们需要帮忙把一些东西搬到上面的办公室（大概是4楼），办公室里非常拥挤，我们很难找到一个站的地方。那时还有一个来自另一个班级/学校的陌生人，我告诉他躲在门后，所以如果老师上来检查，他们不会注意到 - 但即使他们看到我们，我们的怀疑是老师不认识我们班的任何人，所以她可能会认出我们组里有其他人。

可能还有其他事情发生，因为我想在办公室里和一些同学谈论一个我们在教室里没有完成的话题。

我正考虑要告诉Louis的父亲，以及这会有多么有效 - 这会让我感觉像一个小人，还是实际上是一个好策略（因为他可能会或可能不会听从他的父母，因为他们在杭州，但他们可能仍然对他在这里产生远程影响） - 就在我在那里入睡的时候。

当我醒来后，我试图打开灯，但在打开墙上的开关后，天花板上的灯没有亮起。这让我意识到我在做梦。天黑了，我的视觉非常模糊（就像瞌睡而无法睁开眼睛），即使我努力看也看不清楚。我使用了通常的技巧 - 咬一下食指的第二关节，它像橡胶一样。所以我知道这是个梦。

我试了几次（大约3-4次）做一些事情 - 打开灯，找一个地方逃离那个房间，感到太累了然后再次入睡，然后迅速醒来试图打开开关，仍然是黑暗的，试图咬手指，它仍然像橡胶一样。我短暂地怀疑自己是不是太困了（比如在一个舒适的床上午睡了一个很好的午觉，然后在被闹钟提前唤醒时感到非常困），（顺便说一下，在这些情况下的策略是睡不到25分钟，以及在一个不寻常的床上位置睡觉）或者实际上是在梦中。

即使在这个时候，我们的叹息也很模糊 - 没有突然清醒的感觉。这只是基于我的（专业😂）经验的坚定信念，我知道我在做梦，我需要做些什么（由于那些日子缺乏实践，我没有考虑到我的主要目标：去月球）。
窗户是不能打开的，并且外面有那些金属条，我跳上去，它很有弹性，可以伸展一点。

有瞬间的怀疑，但经验告诉我们这是梦，我们继续前进，忘记了我之前在办公室（所以如果那是个梦，而我仍然在办公室，那一定是梦的一部分）。

最后，我真的很努力地敲了敲围栏窗户，它伸展了超过2米而没有破裂，然后我突然出现在窗户的另一边 - 没有设法飞起来。我直接掉到地上。就像几层楼高一样，尽管速度很快，着陆就像棉花球一样 - 我只是粘在地上，没有反弹，现在可以自由地四处走动，一点疼痛也没有（当然）。我现在确信我控制着我的梦境了（没有意识到我仍然在学校！）我的视野现在非常清晰。

有趣的服装和有趣的摩托车。像叛逆者一样，在校园街道上的怪异人物。想到了性，但去掉了这个想法，因为不想醒过来。

整个清醒梦的持续时间并不长。最多1.5分钟。我只是四处走动，依次看到4-5个不同的人。我现在有了这个超能力，如果有人骑摩托车冲向我，我可以在它撞到我之前跳开。总有那么1或2个人骑着自行车总是试图撞我 - 为了好玩，我并不生气，一直在玩。除此之外，环境是一个普通的（尽管有人精心规划的）校园，建筑物分散在远处，否则在建筑方面没有特别之处 - 只是那些不合时宜并且不应该出现在校园的人。

逐渐明朗了。然后我们看到校长和校长在行政楼前经过，看到二楼亮着灯，时间上有了一个跳跃，我们正在与校长交谈。

在房间里我躺在地板上，我带来的一些物品（比如水瓶）也在地板上，窗户是开着的 - 就像有人挣扎着站了起来。就像我梦游了一样。这让我30%怀疑我是否真的跳出了窗户？

我正要告诉他我觉得上课很无聊，所以我需要尝试做一个清醒梦。然后我醒来了。现在我想起来，我可能是去找某个人谈话的。也是在这个时候我想到了“你曾经错过吗”并告诉他我想做个最后的笔记。他说快点，因为他不想等我向他解释 - 这已经相当慷慨了。如果是在中国（我们都在说英语），那些学校的官员肯定会非常生气和愤怒，毫无理由地大喊大叫（或者只是因为他们认为他们比学生更有声望）。

总的来说，这个梦有很多环境的转变和我当时没有注意到的（较大背景）环境的小修改。
