> `determiner(X, Prop, Assn, exists(X, Prop and Assn)) --> [a].`

*(About the quote: It's a DCG clause from the book "Prolog Programming for Artificial Intelligence" 4th Edition by Ivan Bratko - in section 23.3 "Defining the meaning of natural language": "The logical meaning of the tiny determiner 'a' may seem surprisingly complicated". Well, it only makes sense!)*

Welcome to my personal website! <a href="https://github.com/TotalImagine-com/TotalImagine.com"><i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> </a>  

I am a software enthusiast (and a professional). Proudly worked at Blackbird Interactive and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. Nowadays working for my own tech startup Methodox Technologies, Inc.  
I have a long-time secret project that I am still working onüòâ.

## Main Projectsüåâ

There are a few things that I've always wanted to work on but never had a chance to fully materialize: Airi, [MULTITUDE](https://github.com/chaojian-zhang/MULTITUDE), [Deep Dive](https://youtu.be/Rd8E-iSiLZ0), [Parcel](https://github.com/orgs/MethodoxParcel/repositories) (now known as [Divooka](https://methodox.itch.io/)), and [Formless](https://chaojian-zhang.github.io/FormlessProgramming/). Thankfully, OpenAI invented ChatGPT, I discovered [Markdown-based workflow](https://files.totalimagine.com/PDF/KnowledgeMarkdownWorkflow-Presentation_No.1_Rev.0.5.pdf), [Expresso](https://charles-zhang.itch.io/expresso) replaced Parcel (again, replaced by [Divooka](https://methodox.itch.io/)) and [Pure](https://github.com/Pure-The-Language) replaced Formless.

### Project Ideas (Invite for Collaboration)

As mentioned above and as a summary, here are some projects that I am genuinely interested in, and everyone is welcome to collaborate with me. Notice those projects tends to have a non-deteremined production timeline because I cannot spare dedicated time working on them. Also by no means that I will accept collaboration proposal blindly for I don't have time for casual engagements. At the moment, my entire focus is either on work at OTPP, or Project Nine.

For entrepreneurship level endeavours, see <a href="Articles/Entrepreneurship">business ideas</a>.

### Blogs

Blogs (ÈöèÊÉ≥) are like vlogs or weChat moments - it's momental, it's ÈöèÊÉ≥, it's blumbing, but here we try to be more articulated (on the literature level).

### Books

* [(2016) Think & Miss (Chinese) - Book 1](https://files.totalimagine.com/PDF/ThinkAndMiss_Book1.pdf) (Probably needs a better context, e.g. as an introduction article/page)
* [(2025) Introductory Visual Programming in Divooka - A Hands-On Guide to Building Visual Applications](https://methodox-technologies.github.io/TextbookIntroductoryVisualProgramming/)

### Concepts

Cool, fully-finished/half-finished/experimental projects.

(PENDING)

### Reviews

Movie, novel, software, TV reviews and collections. Include: Experience, ranking, excerpts, collections (vocabulary, literacy, scene, sound, etc.).

We do not use an existing well-known platform like Douban because we want full programmable data control and couldn't care less being discoverable by others. Those reviews mostly serve personal interest, serving reference and inspirational rambling and thorough review for the purpose of it, and only occassionally share ideas.

Computing:

* [Toward a formal theory for computing machines made out of whatever physics offers by Herbert Jaeger, Beatriz Noheda & Wilfred G. van der Wiel](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40533-1) (PENDING REVIEW ARTICLE)

Procedural Generation:

* [Cyclic Symmetric Multi-Scale Turing Patterns by Jonathan McCabe](http://www.jonathanmccabe.com/), see [(2018) Turing Pattern](./Articles/TuringPattern)

## Changelogüìë

* 2018: Historical website at [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20180817180122/https://totalimagine.com/).
* 202208: (#Technical) We used to have a 20Mb payload from Airi - it took a while to make the repo clean. In the future anything this huge should deserve its own repo.
* 20220820: (Backend) Update and clean up setup; (Content) Add draft blog [20220820](./Blogs#20220820-a-refurbished-website-and-public-content-posting-scheme-wip).
* 20220821: (Website) Update front page. (Content) Migrate some articles from old personal portfolio websites.
* 20220822: (Front Page) Add "Feature" section. (Content) Draft page for "The Matrix" project; Add draft section for "Dev Log".
* 20221209: We used to treat the repo as a file host of compiled html files and kept source code seperately. This creates additional buld process and seperated source and result files. The reality is, we really don't care about the compiled HTMLs ourselves so we should just let Jekyll do its job.
* 20221210: (Article) Create placeholder for [Knowledge Markdown](./Articles/KnowledgeMarkdown).
* 20230702: (Appearance) Change theme.
* 20230801: (Appearance) Update front page; Clean up and visual formatting.
* 20230823: (Organization) Add section on "Favorite Articles"
* 20231013: (Feature, Interaction) [Integrate Giscus](https://github.com/TotalImagine-com/TotalImagine.com/commit/f5f2eb8c16ff8feeb11965c4dc0b80b65937c461). (Remark) Will stop updating this for trivialities. Viewers are welcome to read [commit history](https://github.com/TotalImagine-com/TotalImagine.com/commits/main) for more details.
* 2025072413: (Front Page) Fix broken links.
