(Been busy these days, will update the website soon!)

Used to work on a variety of personal projects (mostly software), nowadays I focus on my full-time job as Investment Analyst at OTPP, plus a secret side-project!😉

## Projects🌉

There are a few things that I've always wanted to work on but never had a chance to fully materialize: Airi, MULTITUDE, Parcel, and Formless. Thankfully, OpenAI invented ChatGPT, I discovered [Markdown-based workflow](https://files.totalimagine.com/PDF/KnowledgeMarkdownWorkflow-Presentation_No.1_Rev.0.5.pdf), [Expresso](https://charles-zhang.itch.io/expresso) replaced Parcel and [Pure](https://github.com/Pure-The-Language) replaced Formless.

## Changelog📑

* 202208: (#Technical) We used to have a 20Mb payload from Airi - it took a while to pure the repo clean. In the future anything this huge should deserve its own repo.
* 20220820: (Backend) Update and clean up setup; (Content) Add draft blog [20220820](./Blogs#20220820-a-refurbished-website-and-public-content-posting-scheme-wip).
* 20220821: (Website) Update front page. (Content) Migrate some articles from old personal portfolio websites.
* 20220822: (Front Page) Add "Feature" section. (Content) Draft page for "The Matrix" project; Add draft section for "Dev Log".
* 20221209: We used to treat the repo as a file host of compiled html files and kept source code seperately. This creates additional buld process and seperated source and result files. The reality is, we really don't care about the compiled HTMLs ourselves so we should just let Jekyll do its job.
* 20221210: (Article) Create placeholder for [Knowledge Markdown](./Articles/KnowledgeMarkdown).
* 20230702: (Appearance) Change theme.
* 20230801: (Appearance) Update front page; Clean up and visual formatting.
