## Total Imagine - Concept Overview

Tags: #20191013, concept, management, overview, reference

This word (i.e. TI, or Total Imagine) is used in many places without clear definition, worse, it's also used as names for some projects e.g. **TotalImagine.com**. Thus some initial clarification follows:

1. TI in its core is a concept, i.e. the creative power achieved through training/augmented imagination - exactly how such training can be carried, how much creative this power is or can be, how it can be augmented are not defined in the concept yet, and they are the topic of the development that follows.

Definitions and Terminologies:

* (Abbreviation) TI: Total Imagine
1. (Term) Total Imagine: Conceptual training of creative work.
2. (Term) (TI) Canvas: The production form in which our intended design/creation will take.
3. (Term) (TI) Medium: The (practical) method/tool/software through which we will be able to produce intended production.

Misc Notes:

1. (Naming) Per original naming, "Total Imagine" is in verb form - it's not "Total Imagination", however at some places I used later form (e.g. in universal diary when used as a tag) - those have no particular reasoning/significance.
2. (Question) What's the initial date/time I come up with this idea/concept of TI? In what circumstance?

## A Ray-Tracing Method for Hand Drawing

Tags: 20191013, drawing, method, pending

1. Source of Inspiration: When we try to understand the relationship of the objects in the scene to be drawn vs the shapes/volumes/lines that appear on the paper/canvas, we can draw side/top view analysis diagrams to help us establish - and with a little bit math, even to compute - the exact relation of things. This is slightly slow for some objects but with practice I think 1) it can get faster, and can be useful in establishing initial propotions; 2) For organic and other sophiticated objects a sense of intutiive will be developed thus this step can be either quicker or skipped or implied.
2. The idea: I realized we can, in practice, perform that step in terms of TI, by .... (pending development, this note so far just records the existence of this perception, we need to practice it to see its effect then document it)
3. Keywords: TI, Hand Sketching, Ray Traced, Canvas, Stereospace
4. Core idea: Treat your eye as a virtual camera, the subjects as virtual scene, perform (screen space) ray tracing 
5. Inpired by: Water surface reflection - thinking about whether we can see the edge of the terrain and the tall buildings in the distance
6. Idea From/Motivation: When we draw a 3D cube on canvas, what/how/why should it look like? E.g. the perspective, relative sizes.
7. Background Knowledge that motivated this thinking: Ray tracing based rendering, basic trigonometry
