# 20250206 Oscar Prime - great sales, diligent writers, inadequate skills

> Guarantee is shit. You will get dissatisfied, you won't get your money back

They claimed to have lots of publisher work but you cannot see any of the examples. I should have been more cautious then.

For anyone seeking ghost riding it may because he cannot write or it may as in my case want to save time. If you are the later then I'd recommend not going Oscar because it's not going to save your time and it's going to give you frustration. Just use chat GPT - it will do a better job.

If anyone has any questions I am winning to share all the details of our interaction and show you was the actually produce.

Remark: I suppose the compensation scheme demands people not giving refunds otherwise they may lose compensation?
