## Software

### ChatGPT 2022

Date: 2022-12-10

I am surprised it can give you advice as the last paragraph, as if it knows the insufficiency of its answer. The thing is, the answer is complete, as its scope goes - like it knows where to stop producing more words.

### MidJourney 2022 (I)

Date: 2022-12-24

Haven't tried DALL·E 2, but without question MidJourney is the best among other available platforms. The next candiate is Stable/Disco Diffusion.

After experimenting with AI for a few days, there is one thing I really don't understand.

You might want to cover your eyes if you have a soft heart for the remaining of these:

<img alt="Midjourney Woman Default Ugliness 1" max-height="256" src="https://images.totalimagine.com/Midjourney/20221224_default_ugliness_1.jpg"/>
<img alt="Midjourney Woman Default Ugliness 2" max-height="256" src="https://images.totalimagine.com/Midjourney/20221224_default_ugliness_2.jpg"/>

<img alt="Midjourney Woman Default Ugliness 3" max-height="256" src="https://images.totalimagine.com/Midjourney/20221224_default_ugliness_3.jpg"/>
<img alt="Midjourney Woman Default Ugliness 4" max-height="256" src="https://images.totalimagine.com/Midjourney/20221224_default_ugliness_4.jpg"/>

Why, without further modification, that the AI's first generation of human (female) faces always have some kind of blood and stuff?

### MidJourney 2022 (II)

Saw today the news Nutcracker team used Midjourney generated image for ads. What if Midjourney was free, or even open source. Would there still be issues with "stealing art"?
