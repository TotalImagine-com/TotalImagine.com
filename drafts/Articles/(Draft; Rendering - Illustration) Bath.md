Remake detailed renders in Blender 2.8 - Cancelled, consider either making a complete new extension, or don't bother remaking what is already made at all. For instance, we shall prepare the extension such that it can occur in our P9 Concept Preview Movie:
    * When showcasing what's inside city of nine, we can give a glimpse of this place, e.g. as one sequence of the quick shots of successive scenes (well there is a name for this shooting technique - google it all! Topic: Film shooting techniques).

# The Bath

**Brief**

It took me much much longer to contemplate than to build actual models in order to obtain this **20-hour** (total design time) render (excluding actual render time). Clearly nowadays (the image was rendered in *2015*) 20-hr barely qualifies a render as an effortful design, but at that time, and for a long time this image has been, my first and only complete CG rendering. Much had happened before I could even attempt something like that, in particular, I found Andrew Price's tutorials on **architecture rendering** helpful, which taught me basic concepts concerning **lighting** and **space**. But in terms of conception, the vivid memory (not so vivid that it requires no effort to recall, just vivid enough so it's possible to attempt to recall) and retriving techniques I have gradually practiced over the years helped me bring this dreamy image to life. Yes, there is **a lot** that can be improved: lighting, geometry, texture, setup, camera, atmosphere... If I shall have a chance to rework this piece, I will put much more effort into **designing the scene** to convery some more interesting meaning, and of course - character modeling is still my hurdle to become a true CG artist, that can drastically add/alter meaning of a scene. However in terms of my original objective, I think this image serves it very well - I wanted to capture the moment of setup in my dream as original as it can be, and even though that produces a rather "plain" image in the end, it serves its purpose well as a record for a piece of memory.

**Background**

I would like to consider this my first actual render, but technically it's the third (I will update the note/images on first two renders when I get a chance).

No part of this was planned, of course. Even though I was taking **Architecture Academy** at that time, I didn't think of building anything specific yet. As the other render that came after this one, it's also a result of an impulse.

I found it really helpful when you take the time and spend days and hours to really learn and practice something well.

When I think about it, I figured it has more to do with the process, or tools, rather than the techniques.... I used to spend hours and hours just to cracking and installing a non-accesible famous 3D modelling package and fiddle around its complicated interface - nowadays I prefer open source softwares. I just found those software's, though sometimes surprisingly small in size when compared to their commercial counterparts, possess a quality that is missing in those expensive commercial products - I call it elegance. To be fair, such kind of elegance may become inconvenience for industry and professional use, but it's sufficient or even crucial for usability for personal purpose.
....

The scene was adapted from a dream about a girl I liked very much (or shall we use the word "love"?). In the dream one day after a very difficult physics exam she guided me downtown to a place where they served madak and an entertainment place for intimate couples (well in reality neither of us smoke). She danced for me and in the end she lied on the ground and I lowered to her ear asking a question whose answer I knew would break my heart.

In the center of the image she was supposed to be there dancing, but I simply couldn't do character modeling at that time. The render is considered a symbol of sexuality, and it represents what remains left dominant after a long dwelling desire for someone who's distant away. It used to be important to me simply because it's my first materialization of a real dream scene, involving her as my motivation for making it happen.

## Scene Construction 

This scene is a 90 percent realization of the original dream, if I recall it correctly. Further details are lost but everything in the foreground is taken directly from the dream except maybe the decorative items in the standing cabinet. The ambient light (i.e. the one on the top of the ceiling) is an add-on, I simply don't remember what was originally in the dream to light up the whole place.

The dream recall and design process alone took **5 hours**, including the effort needed to figure out room scale and camera, just to design the final render a bit. The outside makda area wasn't modelled when I first create this scene (I do wish someday I can get a chance to work on that)...

The clothes collector (i.e. the [laundary basket](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00DB4MAXC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1)) is modelled exactly as the one I bought from Amazon, several other items are borrowed directly from reality as well (for instance the [Umbra Boomba Bamboo Soap Dish](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B001NGO78Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)). The ivyes are the trivial part, several simulations are done but still in the end it shows some plastic characteristic due to incorrect material setup. Arguably, my computer was having a bit difficulty and when it came to simulation, better planning and practice seems crucial to achieve ideal results efficiently.

The TV doesn't blend well in the environment but well it is what it is (original dream has its function).

The flames on the candles are fake, and the candles themselves can also be greatly improved in terms of modelling and material.
