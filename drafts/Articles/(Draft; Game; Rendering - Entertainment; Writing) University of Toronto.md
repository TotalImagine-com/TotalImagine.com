# Design

1. Not a single bad word, disclaimer is enough for the blame. Make main content condense and useful.
2. No need to talk about non-academical aspects, that and anecdotes can be saved for others to explore for themselves. We want better education and methods and knowledge.
3. Use pointers when necessary to avoid redundancy; Although be careful, that is harder for readers.

# Researches

1. History of UofT
2. History of Engineering (in general)
3. Philosophy of Epistemology
4. A major review of all my studied subjects with a hierarchical layout of textbooks and knowledge foundations (for reference purpose, mind the readers no need to take from the root - start anywhere is good is source material is self-contained)

# References

1. A note of dream on making notes

# Resources

1. A generated Sankey Diagram for knowledge dependency (positive summation of children branches into major philosophical roots)
