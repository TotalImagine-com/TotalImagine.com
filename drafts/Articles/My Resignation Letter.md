To Whom It May Concern (Warren),

It's been 3 years since I joined as an Investment Analyst at OTPP in June 2022, and 7 years since I started my co-op with TFR in 2018. I am glad to say the time has been long, rich, fruitful, unforgettable, and nurturing three years, and it's with great gratitude that I am resigning from my current post. This is a decision I have carefully cooking since early 2023, as I never planned to spend longer than 3 years at OTPP, and I am glad I am finally making the step to fullfill my promise. Working here brought me enormouse wealth while at the time enriches me with plenty of opportunities (most of which unfortunately I am not able to grasp due to limited capacities).

When I came to Toronto in 2022 I had a gloomy moood - I don't feel joy and lack hope for life. I came to Toronto for a fantasy that broke into glorious pieces shortly after. OTPP has given me all that I could have hoped for, and certainly more than what I could have earned otherwise living a normal life - collegues, friends, knowledge, exposure, technical expertise, all the fun and joy and cool places that I would otherwise never have been to. For the first time after coming to Canada since winter 2012, I can say I truly felt the freedom and happiness of live, the joy of living happily and feel the love of those around me.

One thing I learnt from this experience is about lifestyle: by saving myself three hours in the morning I can get minor projects done, and weekends would be for entertainment and relaxation. The working life is highly structured, and I adhere to a strict schedule on both weekdays and weekends. That brings enormous uncomparable peace compared to the messy university life I had before, or the unsatisfying first job I had, which doesn't pays well despite all the fun and excitement, I couldn't satisfy subsistence with a basic urban lifestyle. I am very fortunate to work with all the talented people here at Risk and enjoy all the benefits the company has to offer.

I am still young and it's too early to feel content and live happily there after. Life is too short - and I certainly only live once.
Some may say it's a good idea to try another job, find a new passion, but I think it's time to go to the thing that really mattered to me.
My true passion has always been gaming and film production. I don't know whether I will ever get into that industry. I have many projects and endavours that I haven't got chance to try out, and I really think it matters for me to make use of talents in dreaming and develop that device about what everone is dreaming about - and that probably will never happen if I don't take the risk and step out of the comfort zone now.
As someone who's inherently deeply self-motivated, I am way better left off working alone than being in a larger environment, and even though I could make bits of progress part-time on my personal projects, it's nothing comparable when dive in full time.

It's funny when I came back in 2022, I told Warren the only thing that would stop me from leaving this post would be if I found someone I like (and also likes me). If that's the case, I would want to be content and earn money and live a peaceful life with her. Now it's 2025, I've got my PR, I've found my girl, I have some preliminary funds to support myself, and I still decide to give up all those fortunate blessings and spend time on what may or may not turn fruitful in the end.

If that's the case, at least I won't regret I haven't tried. And I can still come back, and be an ordinary guy like I always was.

Sincerely,
Charles
