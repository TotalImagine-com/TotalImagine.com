# 2022-2023 Work Year Report

Initial Draft: 2023-08-09

(With a focus on work experience)
(Inspired by PEY report)

In this report I will summarize what I've learnt (mostly from work and technical and personal ethics perspective, and skipping all the inter-personal stuff) during this year.

## Ethics

People have a different focus when it comes to getting work done versus new co-ops that aim at improving and contributing things and solve some minor existing problems. For instance, co-ops might find lack of documentation a big issue, however, that issue is only for the maintainers, because for the managers, getting something done not only actually matters more, but is also much more efficient than improving and working on infrastructures - that's because they differ in the measuring of quality of life. Getting more done gives managers more capitals of talk, while code maintainers are the ones that need to deal with all the dirty stuff constantly and suffers from poor living/working conditions (aka. bad codes).
