We cannot and should not rank or compare programming, CG art (both 2D and 3D forms), career work, personal projects, and studies on theoratical physics or mathematics or any other topics of interest. That is to say, when we consider "whether or not this chunk of time is better spent on something over another", we cannot make such judgement based on which one is better.

# Notes

Today (20221213) I realised it's 4 more episodess towards the end of a story I am listening to.

Literature is not just imagination, or not imagination at all if we can look at it this way.

Well-written classics: associavle, relatable post-the-fact, beauty, simple.

中式玄幻网文: System, getting bigger and better, endless, repeated cycles.

When everyone was born, they are like rounded stones - full of possibilities, endless outcomes. Life and society do not simply "limit" us - it shapes us. Such seemingly diminishing feature (or specialization) is the collapsing feature of infinite quantum possibilities. When we were young, we know not of fear or any other wonders of life, as we get closer to death, so is our reality becoming more real than ever.
