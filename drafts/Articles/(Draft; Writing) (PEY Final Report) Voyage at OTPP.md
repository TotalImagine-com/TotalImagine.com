# Remark (Criticism) on the Report (and Its format) and How a more intelligent University (I.e. You-know-which-starts-with-a-w) will handle it

A format serves a function (what? Efficiency...), A report serves a function (research?)....

During the time of this intern, I encountered some Waterloo students, this is how they describe how their university prepare the for the co-ops (lecture, course, information session)... Compared with that, all we got is information session (etc.)... This also reminds me of the difference between Praxis, which is a ..., and .., which is a general engineering version of ....  I bet this is as good as our university can handle it, and I deeply appreciate what is already available. But this is all pure shit compared with what can be perceived possible (by me), and here let's talk about concepts:. .... Actually before that, let me give a few points regarding the use and wary of those information session, interview practice session and all the formats etc. To be crystally clear, unlike others, I do personally find all those things greatly helpful if not also very fun to attend, and unlike many others, I deeply loath and absolutely postpone all activities related to "formats" until much later (j.e. When it's almost too late) - clearly some people like to follow "frameworks", and everyone complains, but only some tries to dsicern the intricacies of those things. This article (of this section of the article) is my feeble attempt (i confess much detailed work is needed and will be worked on much much later after this article is published)....

ID f current format/system:
Comprehensive, scalable, easy to follow (I see only one James following Praxis advice msintisning his own blog on engineering process and handbook, and he's not very good at communicating with people when I knew him though very anticipated person - more measurable achievements simply cannot be expected on every individual), not much development overhead, less sophisticated (and less meaningful)

(A screenshot of original PEY email) The least it could do to improve is 1) Make it sound more like human talking to human, and I assure you that won't cause losing any information; 2) Remove those (stupid) formating and make it easier to read. However, if we shall assume the world is perfect (which I do), then this is already the best they can produce (at this time), with everything considered.....(what a prejudice and superiority!)

Well after reading more carefully about requirements and doing an initial draft, the writing turns out to be quite personal and (humanoid?) rather than technical.
