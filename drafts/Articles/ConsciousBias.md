> Are there any real difference between conscious and unconscious bias?

This is part of Moral Construction topics, posted here on Total Imagine for dedicated drafting. This is an independent development - it may or may not be collected to Moral Construction proper. Unlike most business contexts - the motivation for such an article is entirely intellectual: in exploiting, discovering, and intentionally defining and modifying custom behaviors. Aka, for a style.

The only way for one to discover and train her own emotions is through introspection and writing down personal analysis - reading articles or studying textbooks or watching videos only help inspire, but transpiration is needed to achieve effective results for any matters pertaining to psychology, emotion and personal philosophy. For this reason, while I came across the topic of "unconscious bias" during an employee training session, I think it's interesting to elaborate the topic by exhausting it under Moral Construction. Ignoring thinking is much as ignoring emotions, some prefer the former and others do the latter, or in other words, the mode of our thinking is an effect of our chosen pathway: it's a result of training, much like when picking up a new skill or new art - the first dozen times we do it it will require great conscious effort and memorizing the steps, but after a few hundred time of repetition (especially when mixed with diverse subtle variations of the circumstances), things will start to speed up, and remembering the steps will be effortless - even so, we must recognize that our brain can only be precise to limited steps, so what is "remembered better" is simply a result of optimizing away or compromising in other aspects. For instance, it's not really that we cook better and cook faster because we've done it more, it's simply because throughout the practice we discovered what are the more essential steps and pays attention to what really affects the outcome.

For the approach of this article, since it's mentioned "Over 180 biases have been documented" - we could start documenting those for MC purpose. Though for the moment I don't find it much useful because I think I have no bias because MC has been so successful - maybe this is a bias, but it looks to me I have identified all the biases I have and it's a matter of choice rather than unconsciousness that we do things we do. We will name all the baises for easier identification - but we shall recognize by naming such bias in a few words we are making a conscious decision (and thus creating a bias) in highlighting the most salient aspects of the bias it's trying to identify.

For the purpose of this identification, I would propose an **"emotional reaction test"**: for anything that we think it's a choice, if when we are asked to make a choice otherwise and we feel any slight reluctance to do it, then it is not real choice, but is identified as a bias. For instace: if one shall think I choose tofu as lunch today by choice because it's healthier than fried chicken, and were asked to eat green salads instead. If the person shall take the alternative freely without emotional burden, then it's a free choice, otherwise then person shows clear preference to tofy over green salad - and that identifies a bias. It is once again true as we have discovered for Moral Construction: true free choice is undeterminable for there lack any plausible preference for any particular option over others (and only a random choice shall be made). A single caveat to it is in "menta/physical preparation": we might be developing our saliva for juicy tender chicken salad and not ready for greasy oily pork cutlet, but would be fine otherwise. In this casa it can still be considered a free choice, albeit a time-sensitive one for there require a development phase. This can easily be extended to career and romantic choices.

Here are a few bottom lines: 

* In general, anything related to human or social behavior cannot be asserted for sure - statistically or even "by and large" something might be true, but it's almost NEVER true on any individual level. The meaning of this is the even on a single individual, large variations WILL surely exhibit across many statitical dimensions. For instance, assuming (by complete fiction) a world where tall people are 80% fat, tall people are also 35% great at piano, and fat people are 65% running faster than thin people for no obvious reason, and we identify an individual who is apparently fat and falls in the 80% category of the former dimension - there is only 65% chance for this individual to run faster than thin people, and only 35% to be good with piano. In other words, the more dimensions we can identify as statistical measures, the less certain that any single person can be "stereotyped" because the chances are super slim.

Below are the biases we identify:

1. Communication channel bias: when boss and employee talking using different parts of brain. That's a useful analogy when communicating with others - are we talking on the same channel? Because some things is NOT about problem solving.
2. Gender bias: Per Philosophy of Sex on gender, the difference between genders can be smaller than we expect and variations within gender can be larger than we expect.
3. Assumption bias: Assuming someone is good for anything is a bias unless certified through statistical measures on actual performance. For instance, I am bad with exams, but I am pretty decent with GUI application programming.
4. (From external source, pending review) In-Group bias: PENDING. the tendency to be more helpful and positive toward members of our own group over members of an out-group. We feel good about people who are like us.
5. (From external source, pending review) Sunk-cost bias: PENDING. Sunk cost is not "cost" - it's sunk piece of shit. It doesn't not count into future planning.
6. (From external source, pending review) Negativity bias: PENDING. the tendency for us to focus or dwell on negative experiences. Something very positive will generally have less of an impact on a personâ€™s behavior than something equally emotional but negative. 
7. (From external source, pending review) Confirmation bias: PENDING.
8. Race bias: If one never heard shit talk against any race praise talk for any race, then one won't have race bias. Or one simply need to postpone making "observations" or generalization on races.
9. I Bias: We should all write i in lower case instead of upper case.

After identifying the bias, we can work around it using a few techniques:

1. Correction technique: Walk out of comfort zone, do the thing we felt reluctant to do five times or more. A modern version of it is "fake it untill you like it". If one can rewire one's brain quickly and be open to exploration, then it won't take more than a few trials to open up one's mind.
2. Cover-up technique: Identify the dimension of bias, and remove it by covering up the obstacle dimension. Classic example is "blind auditions without shoes".
