# Misc

1. Add category: University Sh*t (Change to: University Throwaway), and try to put useful Ut projects there. Don't push for absolute quality though, be strategic. (Category Intro)"Don't get me wrong, I love my university and the sh*t part has nothing to do with knowledge I learn. I am just trying to find a place to put those things I did yet not quality per my other standards, and show how much I don't f***ing care about administration."

# Website Rules

1. Even though we agree to show some **in-progress** articles on website, for **presentation** we still need to make sure at least **the articles are readable** (it can be **incomplete**, but it cannot be a **total draft**). For that purpose it's wise to separate **content design** from **content presentation** - thus it's wise to put all **raw articles** here (in the folder), and only when we are ready put them on the website.
    * However for need of modification and constant update, we also need a complete copy of the article on mobile so we can possibly edit it with context, in that case we decide: 1) for long articles they deserve dedicated files, 2) For drafts and short articles just put them all together in batches to save some bandwich during synchronization.
2. It's also easier to discuss **article designs** using dedicated sections of documents in this way without conflicting with front-end views.

# Site Updates

**Collective**

* The PEY article is not visible in nowhere.
* (Bug) The images viewing page (e.g. for Turing Pattern) seems not rendering MD for header paragraphs.
* "Landscape" for Photography category wrong spelling
* Also see post "Personal Portfolio todo-list and Updates"
* About Me: Add "Mate with one of the sexual objects I love or someone else, in a magnificent way (I don't mind if it's after death) - what have I done toward this ambition actively?
    * A few cool things I study: dreams, sexuality, morality.
* About me: Add Affinity Design (though confess about design ability), Love: Peace, Chaos, Balance; Hate: Oversimplification
* Change a background word to "expectation" - it's stronger.
* Hobbies: Programming, Masturbation - well I wouldn't say those are always "enjoyable", or maybe to some diminished degree they are. No, to me I think I am professional enough to claim  I am always doing those, no matter what I was feeling at the moment.
* Pending consoldation of overall notes on Web Development tiddly wiki on Personal portfolio - collection, implement, discard some. Consider creating a SW Home for it.
* Upload that video we shot with Cheryl to portfolio as well.
* Change one background keyword to "Risk"
* Personal toolsets (collection): OpenFL (2D drawing), Process 3 (2D drawing), Qt (Cross platform app, performance app, drawing)
* (About page) Add attribute line: Paradigm (Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, Aspect-oriented programming, Nihilism)
    * (Implementation) By the way the whole about page should be a single Markdown value (instead of a YAML dictionary) so it's more flexible.
* Concept 修改说明: It is more about a concept -> It is all about a concept. 这样更好体现我们Integrity的哲学。之前more about 是因为觉得或许制作不出来， 表达的是more about a idea, which is not quite meaningful.

**Posts**

1. Add to baycest project question list: inspirational source - Software development /solution architecture learning background as a source
2. Change Redeem category link to category blog page; Add separate social icon “梦“ for Redeem page
3. Turing pattern generator create/review date is wrong 
4. Add meta description and keywords tag (don't bother further customization, currently just use post tags and category)
5. Photography Perspective: 补上完整的视角、也可以这个机会顺便添加点细节、修正之前不完善的效果——（Bath）1.从角落看电视的方向，2.拍摄正对着壁陇的方向，3. 侧面拍摄昏暗灯光墙壁药匣、以及可以补上药匣上的字、用恰当的字体；（Balance Beam Dance）1.特写挂串 2.特写淋浴间🚿 3.从上面往下拍摄、把人物用CD重做
    * 注意梦的渲染的特点：很新、很干净、虽不至于鲜艳但是还算亮丽（区别于如果做类似现实中的特效会稍微灰尘多一些、颜色平和些
6. About me page summary collection: 
    * Web: D3 (pending), Observable (Pending), NPM/NodeJS (Pending)
    * 2D Animation: Blender Grease Pencil (Pending), OpenFL (pending), DragonBone (Pending), Processing (Low Level, Pending), MotionArtist (Pending)
7. Other languages (acquiring): JavaScript, F#, Haskell (Decent familarity especially with music related application), Haxe, Java (Decent familarity especially with database and socket programming, not a fan of Java GUI programming)
8. Add 苍蝇王渲染

**Bugs**

1. Front-page posts not properly linked; Turing pattern post not properly categorized.
2. Front page highlight area post not working 

**Issues**

1. Front page navigation sucks, not usable on mobile (only work when scrolling at the side of screen)
    * Look like is because scrolling is interrupted by fade-in animations 
    * look like we had an extra inner scroll region compared to the template
2. Also jump to head seem conflicting with some scrolling effect on Mobile
3. Header title Charles Zhang can use bold on mobile
4. Portfolio page categories are blocking description text for the page on mobile.
5. Overall experience on mobile is very laggy.
6. Time table app links to Domino.zip which is not correct

**Visual and Navigation Improvements**

1. Change " - " to " | " for titles 
2. Portfolio page don't show posts without header image
3. Do provide back to post button on images page, for mobile it's convenient
4. Emoji on About Me page is not showing on Win7 machine 
5. Allow contact default filling through "default" attribute for Contact page message form
    * E.g. in Redream we have "[Redream] (Suggestion) " as default 
6. Redream cover image: 灰黑纸张五颗白色glowing小星星五角星排列
    * Midium thickness, slightly rounded corner, curvature edge, layout in a circle, rim light, lightly gray white,
    * 圈圈、五边形、雨滴
    * It means "the protector of night"
    * 灵感：神秘五角星、Redream Tiddly颜色、闪烁光芒；20190512电雨和甲单。
    * Design II: 六边形白杠倾斜或者平行，中间镂空R
    * Design III：因为反正都没啥特别的意义，就直接用个五角星（Straight、Thin、Lined），上面加个星雨

**Design Principles**

4. (Photography) No nude. It's easier to make a point with naked bodies. Unlike oil painting, photographers are better off using naked bodies in their work.

**Side Projects and Feature Request**

1. Crate Universe - Cool Symbols to Study and Use: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_mark?wprov=sfla1
2. Enable sending Gmail notification when people post messages because we cannot just view what's in the table from Azure and it's not convenient to download the whole thing
3. In the end (maybe one year later I.e. 2020.05) we will need to host it using Ubuntu+DigitalOceam+Let's Encrypt for more economical value and practical reasons (because having a real VPS enables us to for instance inspect contents of database using command line).

# Category Treatment

1. Concept Design (as a speech to self):

> I say: "Remember this name, because ten years from now, you shall hear it everywhere!" - A Charles Zhang Concept (Inspired by: Project Nine - A Concept Preview)

# Considerations

1. It it not suitable to have RBC logo because we are not authorized to use its brand
2. Don't use any non-completely original contents e.g. early flash and RPG Game Maker games

# (Site Organization; Implementation; Content Design) Blog -> Called "Post"

1. Use blog to organize category and tags
2. Use blog to publish serious contents (with proper non-date based organization it can look formal)
3. Use blog for general ''sharable information oriented resource'' so we don't need to create a brand new website/application for just anything
4. For ''Concept Design'' (main) category: it's easy to do self-protection actually, besides publish only partially complete concepts compared to the ones we will use in CofN - just make sure the things we publish are hardcore containing real complexity so the appreciable reader will either attribute us or contact us for further information. As such, as long as we publish really valuable/thoughtful stuff (rather than simple drag-n-drop contents), people will be able to appreciate it properly. Besides, one should never be afraid of running out of new ideas.
5. Use blog to share reference-like downloadable resources.
6. Use blog-data table for pages with custom logics (custom pages per post type handled in the same  post model with some of the page features turned on or off e.g. category navigation style)

# Discipline

1. Everything on the portfolio should be in English. For non-english articles use other children websites.
2. Everything should be professional, high quality, original and require human hours. Also we should try our best to build aesthetically appealing experience.

# Serving

* For redream, serve through a controller not as a raw file, so we can: 1) Do parsing in the future whicj hopefully not 2) Do logging, rather than injecting analytics code inside the file 

# Website Implementation Features

1. Enable post embedded `pre` and `post` sections for embedded header and body scripts (library loading).

# Change Log

**Misc.**

* Adjust "CFA" related ambition wording: one cannot say "become a CFA" but instead should be "become a CFA chart holder" or don't mention it

# A Method of Self-Check Languages

Specifically, we care about the meaning of **terms**.  So a word is either: **common English word**, **specific terminology**, **made-up terminology** which have specialized meaning and context, or *an innocent looking common English word* which is actually considered a terminology or simply have a more denser meaning. We have exaggerate terms by using **bold texts**, and exaggerate meaning or imply questions by using *italics*. Now those two stylized must be very specific and used strictly so people can get s consistent feeling. For instance bold texts should only be used for nouns, adjectives, or noun-like phrases rather than whole sentences or verbs. And we use bold texts only when it's short and succinct.

Per MC, we also use **plain meanings** and don't oversimplify stuff - in a sense more justifications the better as long as it's **readable** and **well organized**. One issue with readability is however sometimes we look at a word differently than others especially when we are using some words that others might not immediately get the meaning. To solve this problem, we need to make sure we explain *every word we use that might confuse others*, unless of course, the note is written for ourselves, which we should be aware of and never share those notes casually with others otherwise people get confused.
