# For "Category Main" articles

Those are the initial articles we have that briefly starts the catagory (i.e. used as slideshow image) - in that case we can consider (and may or may not) have elaborated discussion and **extended implementation** (more important than discussion) of those.

Where is the article?

- Coin Dispenser
    + Here is some of my thought on the coin dispenser: this device seemed cumbersome enough to use and due to lack of documentation (though I have documented a few functions I figured out) it doesn't seem very maintainable in the future. I know you guys surely have made the choice ... (although I cannot say that)
    + That looked like some very specialized device and not publically available
    + I am just curious how do their other clients normally use this device - specially consult their engineers? Or maybe does it come with a software/SDK after all?
    + Need async handling of dispensing, because it's taking too long: or execute without waiting
- One thing I really can't help but to mention is the dependency on Windows API and wxWidgets and those stuff: those needs naturally arise during our development process and I tried to isolate them into separate programs because otherwise we lost our original intention to use SFML as a framework for building the application. The scale as we are developing now really isn't suited for SFML given the timeline and unfortunately the short iteration speed at Baycrest. (There is no need to re-propose, "one more time" - we probably should either just do it in grayground or not)

# On Law of Nature and Mattress Systems

1. Idea Path: Spring System Control - (3D in single slice cut dimension)Mattress System - Curvature of Surface Shape upon weight - Path of least effort - 
	* (??!!) The principle of termal dynamics - Entropy of self organization without external force (not just input, but pressure) always lead to high entropy?
	* Judgement/prediction of others' decision making (even if deceptionally more "difficult", as I expect) - Applicable to conscious/unconscious(impulsive) decisions ? 
		* With some wiki research we discovered other psychology researches are already trying to apply this but since it clearly *doesn't always work* so it's at most pseydosciece, which means it may and can and should be further developed, but before it's development it also means as a heuristic it may or may not work so much further justification and experiments and theorization is needed

# Jungle Zombies, A Reflection - Also A Commemoratio of Flash's Action Script (July 20th)

Several days ago I was interviewing two students from UofT computer science (and economics). In their resume one claimed he has build a "whole suite of restaurant management softwares" and the other claimed experience with "web design" and built a fiarely sophisticated website himself.

...

(What happened to flash? What are the substitudes; Future journey in Haxe)

This project was done in a week (full time) while I was at high school/what time (?!). For a long time I hesitated to put it in my portfolio because: it's visuals are more attractive than my other hardcore programming focused projects however its graphical contents do not belong to me at all to a large extent (at that time) so I hesitated. The other reason was for something like this, even though it turned out played well and even more self-contained and functional than many of other of my own partially complete yet more technically chanllenging programs (simply because it's made with a tool rather than written by hand), I usually don't consider it "original" enough to be deserved mentionoing. 

Usually for something like this I tend to just forget about it and let it go, even though in terms of design and scripting it does contain some non-trivial details. However after the interview with those two students who are looking for co-op positions - let's be fair, they are just 3rd year and probably haven't done much programming before university, and course load at uoft is heavy - they claim to have done something that sounded splendid, yet when I check their code amount, it's too trivial to be even considered scrathed the surface of the target domain they are trying to apply. So what can be considered more valuable, both from code's perspective and learning experience's perspective?

It reminds me of a time when Flash was popular (and pirated) in China, when lots of very creative .....

We were even taught how to use Flash to make simple animations and scenes in secondary school! That in my opinion is a great piece of software that nothing compares even nowadays - maybe RPG Maker. Although I will never use that again - not because I am not willing to or I no longer appreciate its beauty, but because I am forced and inclined to make something more realistic and sophisticated so people can consume?

What's actually insecure about it, and why can't it be fixed simply through API control?...

# \[University\] The difference between computer science and computer engineering - an observation

> Enigineers deal with complexity. Computer scientists study algorithms.

I am certainly not an eingeer - I am a third year computer engineering student with the slightest hope of graduation any soon. But I have observed such patterns between CS and CE during and outside work - ...

When it comes to design an system, what you need is ....

Let's talk about a practical example of (game engine architecture)

Let's talk about a practical example of (risk simulation system)

Now it comes all down to software design. Let's talk about a practical example of (software design in terms of website full stack + indie game vs python based scripts that can handle trillion of files). What's the difference ? On the most biased term, the programming world is divided into those who are proficient with python and front-end frameworks and who are not familiar with intricacies of operating system, programming language, and computer architecture, vs those who may or may not ....

Topics for practice

1. What's the differencn between literature and ordinary writing? I feel it has something to do with the artistic level, or perceived beauty?
* Also put this into questions of all sorts
* Also summarize results into Handbook.

# (Software) (Concept Design) Tag Note - Items that are Tagged

Partly continue the discussion on MULTITUDE.

The proper way to define database tables: think about its actual structural function in terms of necessary programming need, avoid over factorization and strong types.

# Somewhere App - A Theory

A good concept design should have two metrics that make it both lasting and useful: 1) It has a theory; 2) It has an implementation. That give it a style.

The background for Somewhere is mentioned in my article for MULTITUDE. The implementation is in my repository. For an overview, see Somewhere's landing page. Here we cover the theoretical part.
