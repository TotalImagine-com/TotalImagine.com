# Ten Years of Project Nine (Me Version)

It's worth noting that a large proportion of time (within The Monolithic framework aka. counted towards actual contribution) (excluding the effort we spend on programming various tools most of which turns out to be transient and is thus not of much real use besides serving reference purpose of "failed attempts") is spent outside the domain of actual textual or imagery work - something I would otherwise ineivtably love to have and would be fun to just play with (which I should be able to given our familiarity with most of the chosen software nowadays without being bothered by distraction of unfamiliar interface anymore as long as we have enough personal time outside work). This includes most significantly, researching and reading. That is, especially when we approach writing topics that involves thinking and concerns scientific subjects (like space and time) - depending on how we look at it, we should and indeed spent lots of time to find relevant reseach papers and studying the subjects in detail instead of merely rely on our intuitive and rudimentary understandings. Though it can be argued that from an artistic or literature perspective, such time is better spent just creatively (working with what we have) producing work.
