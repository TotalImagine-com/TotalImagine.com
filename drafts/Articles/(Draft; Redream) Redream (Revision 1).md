# What Are Dreams, On Talking about Dreams, and On Writing It Down

> He who dreams of drinking wine may weep when morning comes; he who dreams of weeping may in the morning go off to hunt. While he is dreaming he does not know it is a dream, and in his dream he may even try to interpret a dream. Only after he wakes does he know it was a dream. And someday there will be a great awakening when we know that this is all a great dream. Yet the stupid believe they are awake, busily and brightly assuming they understand things, calling this man ruler, that one herdsman—how dense! Confucius and you are both dreaming! And when I say you are dreaming, I am dreaming, too. Words like these will be labeled the Supreme Swindle. Yet, after ten thousand generations, a great sage may appear who will know their meaning, and it will still be as though he appeared with astonishing speed. - Source Pending Verification

So far as we know for certain: dreams are the visuals, sensataions, and behaviors we do (or we observe) while we are asleep. Dreams are inspitational sources. I personally never douted the reality of reality.... Maybe only great philosophical minds are curious enough to have that kind of association.

This will be an ongonig "in-development" note about dreams on a high level.

Most dreams are ordinary, others can be fearful; People don't know or are not capable of describing their dreams, they are chaotic or massive in information content, emotional, mixed all together with inadequate expressive skills, lack of a language. Cause trouble.

I once had a friend, who was curious about many things, and in particular she would like to hear about my dreams. Her dreams are like her, usually peaceful and sweet, concerning things in everyday life; My dreams are sometimes wilder, involving more actions and fantasies.

Bring back the sophistication! There are things I would never have imagined, there are things I would never have learnt, if not for the dreams I had, and I will not become who I am. I am an ordinarily special person, so I bet everyone else is just like me.

## Immortality in Dreams

One person I really liked, because I have read a lot about his writings in the past, is Robert A. Monroe, or Bob.

# A Brief Summary of Features of Dreams

Some of the sentences below are **taken** directly from *other sources* (i.e. I didn't state them), in such cases they are quoted without given credits because: 1) I didn't say them so I need to quote them. This is mostly for my own benefits of not mistakenly think I said something I didn't; 2) Their credibility is not important in this section of the article but merely (the form of) the statements so no credits is given to avoid unnecessary distraction.

1. Can be conscious
2. Can be planned
3. Can be fearful
4. Can not be said to always involve positive or negative experience (i.e., as anything else, such statements simply cannot be made)
5. "While one dreams, one does not normally realize one is dreaming"
6. Dreams possess a quality of sensation that is extremely similar to the one we had in usual reality
7. Some claimed one cannot experience pain in dreams
8. Some claimed dreams are susceptible to absurdity while the waking life is not
9. Some claimed in dreaming we do not really believe, we only make-believe
10. Some claimed for people who tell dreams it's questionable whethey they really had these images while they slept, or whether it merely seems so to them on waking
11. "Dreams cannot exist independently of the waking impression"
12. Some claimed it's absurd to deny that one is awake
13. "Dreams are coded into **symbols**"

## Some Interesting Arguments

1. (Philosophical) "Those who argue that the world is not simulated must concede that the mind — at least the sleeping mind — is not itself an entirely reliable mechanism for attempting to differentiate reality from illusion." (*Wiki - Dream argument*)
    * I personally find dreams can mess up with real life when we are not careful; And dreams in detail and retrospect can help us better perceive and define our real life, which in term can help build the dreams
2. (Philosophical) "Whatever I have accepted until now as most true has come to me through my senses. But occasionally I have found that they have deceived me, and it is unwise to trust completely those who have deceived us even once." - René Descartes (*Wiki - Dream argument*; Source and context not verified)
3. (Philosophical) "What this world would be internal to if this were all a dream?" - Valberg's personal horizon (*Wiki - Dream argument*; Source and context not verified)
4. (Ethical) "They (dreams) are really meaningful to you but not to anybody else" (*Why You Shouldn't Tell People about Your Dreams By Jim Davies*)
    * Like when discussing anything else, it's advisable to **think about our audience** and their reactions; Some people are really interested in hearing others' dreams though
5. (Ethical) "Dreams can be so weird because they are interpreted from chaotic information" (*Why You Shouldn't Tell People about Your Dreams By Jim Davies*)
    * A weird thing is when you say dreams are wierd - it sounds wierd; What about we call dreams just dreams? Or maybe call them "fantasies"?
6. (Ethical) "Emotion comes first, and dreams are made to make sense of our basic emotions"
7. (Ethical) "Most dream emotion is negative" (*Why You Shouldn't Tell People about Your Dreams By Jim Davies*)
    * Those who make such assertions are unethical and irresponsible
8. (Technical) "Dreams are an integral part of personality analysis" (*Why you shouldn't tell people about your dreams By M.Farouk Radwan*)
8. (Ethical) "If you tell a dream, that you don't understand, to a person and this person understood the dream then they might know very sensitive information about the way you think." (*Why you shouldn't tell people about your dreams By M.Farouk Radwan*)
    * It's like telling others how much you have in your bank account.

# The First Principle of Reality

For me the most serious question I have asked about the realism of my dreams so far concerns love: Is the girl I am dreaming about real, as in reality, and is my love for her real? After you have experienced such dreams and concerns enough, and if you are sincere to yourself, you will notice the inconsistency between dream experience and the reality.

A thought doesn't really become a (铭刻) idea inside our brain/behavior until we have experienced it - unlike having a random thought in the canonical reality - no matter how wild e.g. win a lottery - that thought is largely innocent/safe. However when you do had a thought/experience/feeling in your dream and there are corresponding experience building towards it, that thought gets "exercised" and now it's burned in your brain - want it or not. You experienced it, so it's more real than anything - even if it's just a fantasy. Things change, people change, technology change, from the perspective of eternal movement of the universe, nothing stays intact - except our memory - if we actually remember what happened - and we don't, so we need to write things done. And we must have the descipline to be able to tell things exact and constantly depute ourselves.

Like many other things: if it's well defined and we cannot unprove it, then it's probably right - untill someday we can disaprove it.

For instance if we define god as the mother nature, then I totally agree everything is ultimately originated from the god; However if we define god as an individual capable of thinking and thinks just like us yet has a form that no one has ever seen before and we can easily get around without this argument, and you still believe such a god exists - well that's your religion and your freedom. Fact is, you can go with pretty much anything and construct a world from it if you so attribute your meaning to things, but some constructions are just less profound than others.

Everything we experience is a dream. This include things we do, emotions we go through, and other sensory and factual things. Notice I called this the first principle of "reality" rather than the first principle of "dream", because to me there is practically no difference between the canonical reality and dream reality (or in that sense, computer world and dream reality) - if so far as those worlds constitute our experience and they contain rules specific and useful in that reality (e.g. you gotta to build a shelter otherwise you will die in the night in Minecraft), and in so far as we (intentionally or unconscisouly live in it) it is real.

Our experience and knowledge is gathered through a varierty of different realities.

In my dictionary, I used to call this a "mirror": The world behaves in a way we expected it to be, in so far as it's intuitive to us. If everything in the world behaves in a way that we always find natural - then congratulations, you are a wasted person that take everything for granted and the world can't expect anything new from you - though maybe your children still do. Me personally, always doubt the ways things appear to be, for instance why the education system in this modern world is so poor - however this is gradually making more sense to me now as I learn more history.

There is one super real dream, called the canonical reality. We never wake up from this reality and that reality is constituted of many many smaller individual realities. Unlike orginary dreams, when we die, we may never wake up.

Do not mess up reality with dreams; Keep a record of sources of ideas.

Some of the articles online are so hard to read (I am refering to source **7** and **8**). 

Without questing about their credibility but assessing purely based on the content, I extracted some useful/new/unware information as below.

* Some people's dreams are dreadful
* Some people are fascinated by dreams
* Dreams are related to rapid eye movement periods of sleep
    * By the way according to a source I cannot recite here, REM period eye movements synchronize with lucid dreams
* Dreams can have emotional force on people

One should be careful when **instructing others** what should and should not be done. I think we **should** help poor people and split all rich people's money to everyone else, and I also think we **should** have children in the work force and adults educated in school.😳
    * One should seriously be careful about making assertions and talk about things like "something often happens"

# Notes

Why we shouldn't talk to others about our dreams, and why we should write it down

# Remarks

1. As this article focuses on high-level aspects about dreams (usually "what" questions), content specific treatments will be in my dream journal and related notes in this [page](/Dream)
2. Robert A. Monroe died soon after my birth, that's not relevant, but that helps me remember him.
3. An article is not bad because it's opinionated, it can be quite enjoyable. no matter whether the opinion is surprising or unexpected. Aesthetics is one example. Some beauty is just hard.

# Redream - What's going to happen and about my dreams

I published ...

It's an attempt to, and part of MC...(avoid confusious talking).

I want to share, to build. I am partly aware what I am tlaking about.

# The first principle of reality (add on). 

We need to explicitly mention the question of affection in canonical reality when we are attracted by others.

* Dreams don't need to be sweet.

# Ask an Intelligent Question about Dreams

...

**Unrelated**

1. Why are dreams not consistent? 
    * Dreams cannot be consistent, otherwise it impose great danger to the living reality. However this is clearly not a evolutionary explanation rather than a retrospective answer.

**Wild Sorts**

1. If you know you are dreaming/you can control your dreams, what will/can you do?
    * I never had a very complete plan for this. An attempt has been drafted in [Redream](Redream). Here I shall tall about some **directions**.
    * Following an **inspirational dream journal** (per ???) - we can study the state/matter of dream worlds. I remember used to see discussions about this when I was reading ???'s **astral projection** talking about **Alice Effect** and thought that was pure boring and who would "waste time" when finally gained control in a dream world? Turns out it can be just fun and great fulfilling just to carefully **examine** the world you are in.
2. Can I legally have sex in dreams? Can I forcefully take off other girls' clothes in dream?

# Important Points to make

1. How do you keep yourself sane in a wild word? How do you keep yourself **"reasonable"** when you have immersed in an **imaginary world** for too long?
    * Living a life is really easy, so is living in ignorance. The scariest thing in life, second to death and bankruptcy, is discovering you have been wrong all the time believing something/someone/yourself is right.
