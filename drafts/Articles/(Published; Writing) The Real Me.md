# Design Notes

1. Background image can use that polygon duck, this is for filling purpos so we have some image to show
    * Ideally though, we would want something more original and less graphically intensive, maybe a piece of photography

## What this article is not going to talk about

1. To avoid clustering, a history of personal development is not necessary and not needed. Unless we devote a dedicated section to it (e.g. at the end of the article) and use that to fully reflect on the growth process)

## What this article is definitely going to talk about

1. The topic about CURRENT favourites is a good one to start with, elaborate it
2. It's a chance to elaborate on the obsession with creating a world (or 4 worlds, for that matter) in a dedicated section

# Review

Send to Ding.

# Problems

So far so good.

# Next

Now make it good and impressive. After all the shit mentioned, it's time for something real.

# Self-Intro (The Real Me)

The introduction given on **About Me** page sounds like a **Linked-In pitch** (which is where it's adapted from) rather than something more authentic. 

We want truth, so here it goes:

* "I am everything I wanted to be, everything I have been, and everything I will become." But who am I kidding?!

I live a **pathetic**, **meaningless** life and I write **softwares for fun** because I have nothing else to do (For the past few years the softwares I wrote were only intended for myself until I discovered **Github** and start to use **Open Source softwares**). I dispute money, authority and God because I know and have experienced so much they can't affect me. I wish I could live in a forest or countryside but I can't even survive in the wild without electricity. I hate modern city life and resent existing schooling and universities so I try hard and go mad inventing and designing my own moral framework and educational systems. I wish everyone can live in peace and happiness but the world is full of bullshit so f**k you everyone (not those we meet on the street but those we meet in the "institute")! People consider me not giving a damn to a lot of things they value but I care so much I love so much I care enough writing my own books documenting my deepest empathy about things others are too busy to even think about. 

I creat this portfolio because I need it for a job not because I like telling people what I am busy with, but I end up caring less about hiring managers and instead I am really writing this for those who can appreciate my work not for the mundane who are afraid of the complexity of human minds. I want my audience to really learn something from my experience rather than find my words funny and consider it a joke or entertaining. I emphasis on **readability**, **searchability**, **organization** and **referenceability** so I mark keywords so it's obvious. I have no hidden intentions, I play no practical tricks. I tell whatever my mind recalls.

# The Real Stuff

> No mistakes, no progress.

It (Programming) is like dealing with girls, but with a chance to practice with the same technique many many times until you get really good at it. The untold secret is, a good production takes effort and many iterative work.

# Questions and Answers

Some questions I ask myself while come up with this article:

* Do you identify yourself as a **team player**?
** *Business is business*. Be professional. Humans are **contextual** animals. I hate teammates who ask a lot of questions and don't read documentation but I used to be a jerk and make decisions no one else can follow so I learn to be patient and exlain things.
* Is the tone of this article a little bit ... **"negative"**?
** What are you afraid of? Is negagive a bad thing? If a word/tone/emotion is really that bad then why do people invent that word, or why do God create that emotion in us? Don't be stupid, we are what we are. *Whatever is natural is good*, and it's in our nature that we can and exhibit traits that are sometimes depressing - but behold, such emotions can become a motivating power no less powerful than so-called "positive" emotions which in modern world can simply be mundane consumer behaviors and lame jokes. I am using a mostly negative tone in above paragraphs because that's easier for me to express and because that's **the real me**.

# Preferences

1. If [Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) (pending futher research) is right about [Psychoanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis), then I guess a person's **preferences** can tell a lot about *who he really is* - what's more crucial is the **reasons** why someone likes the things he likes. Those are **values** and **altitudes** subject to **interpretation**, so it's especially important that I tell it explicitly why I like the things listed here, and *maybe that can surprise you*.

## Animations

When it comes to "favorite" things, there can be **"subjective favoritism"** (pending further research) and **"objective favoritism"** (pending further research). The former represents momentary **emotional responses** to the stimulus, the latter concerns **moral values** associated with the subject being considered.

**Rick and Morty**

This **comedy seires** definitely triggered some **laugh** in me, and it has the magical power and **"plot density"** that I can watch it a second time without feeling knowing everything beforehand.

What surprised me about this **mature animation** is the values being represented in the show is actually called [Nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism) (pending research), which denies the meaning of certain aspects of life (contrary to the existential nihilism view that life is completely meaningless/lacks intrinsic value) and the world is divided into smart people who knows this rule and actively make use of it and the mundane who are bonded by their unescapable emotional constraints.

How wild can our ideas be when we are the smartest person in the universe and don't need to care about nothing mundane? Rick's careless behaviors echos well with Morty's emotionally-bond affection to the world and the eye-opening imaginations usually end well with moderate ????... I personally don't know what I can do with a lottery ticket except maybe use it to continue further study in school (because my life is so boring I couldn't care less about entertainment), but to other people what more creative things can they do except affording their children?

**Doreamon**

Not a super fan nowadays but definitely childhood favorite. I think *this kind of anime* is quite representative and other of my favorites used to belong to this category: **Sword Art Online**, **Naruto**, **Steins;Gate**... I grew up watching Japanese animation, hum..., maybe that tells quite a bit about me.

## Novels

Frankly I don't recall reading a lot serious novels. Maybe I watch magazines more.

**Zhu Xian (2006)**

*This novel affected me a lot*. I would confess it really is a **dangerous thing** for an unprepared young mind to see/read things with such fidelity, and being totally imaginative the fidelity is mostly **fiction** rather than exposure to the real world - that can cause **deep confusion** in innocent minds. What is evil about **youth education** (from where I was from) is that the youth are so well-protected *they don't know what the real world is like until it's a bit late*. It's not that they cannot handle the complexity of real world, it's that the they are troubled with all those "children's matters" that are completely made-up because *they are bored by the limited exposure/access they have to the real world*.

Unfortunately I think the book was really bad at illustraing the point **"What is true righteousness"** except kept asking that question (and depicting a lot a people fighting around). What touched me most was the **emotions** of the characters and the effects they incurred. Being young and not done much at that time, this novel rendered most of my humane experience and **admiration**.

I should probably read this book again now it has been many years since I last reviewed it, this time with a bit **more critical thinking** to overcome the moral effects it has embedded inside me.

**Dream of the Red Chamber**

Something I haven't finished and something I am still working on. I will devote **a category** for it on this website.

## Anim Movie

Anim movies are a special kind of art media, in that they have a level of generalization that is otherwise hard to convery in modern film movies.

**Big Fish & Begonia**

Do you know what surprised me most when I think about my relationship to everyone around me? That people are actually different, different from me. This difference is not in our education, our backgroun, our interests, our ambitions, but more in the form of a "fundamental" difference between the very pursuit and meaning of each other's life. There is a concept in Chinese Buddhism culture that translates roughly to "difference", and it's said by some the recognition of this difference between ourselves and others is bad for a person's appreciation of many things. Well I pretty much appreciate it....

The reviews on this movie diverges as much as that for the game ??? Some people are very very critical about it. That alone raises mild interest...

Life exchange life... One must have a motivaition to push him strongly... An 'incentive', you may call it...

I realized, one must make this decision explicitly sometime in his life: do you decide to become part of the world and behave as everyone else do, or want to really become yourself and risk losing everytning you have. Surely our life is dynamic and nothing gets settled forever, but a man must be brace enough to have this realization in mind, so at times he can make decisions in his own style.

**Spirited Away**

One thing that is so special about this anim movie is that it's **details of imagination**, or **plans**. It's far too easy for authors to spend a lot of time on replicating real world complexities than to contemplate on a self-contained complete environment.

## Movies

**Arrival (2016)**

Universal language.

**Harry Potter**

The more I watch it, the more I love it. Novels are good as well.

I wouldn't say this series is very *intellectually deep*, but compared to all the fantastic novels (xianxia) back in China, it definitely has more humane touch to it.

## Historical Periods

**Three Kingdoms**

I knew the names of famous heros of Three Kingdoms before I knew what history is.
