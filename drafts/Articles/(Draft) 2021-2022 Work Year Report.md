# 2021-2022 Work Year Report (Blackbird Interactive)

> Ideally we work on yearly report when memory is fresh - building up notes throughout the year. But it's not that bad if we do a review shortly after.

Initial Draft: 2023 Aug

The most memorable thing about my time at BBI is not that directly related to the studio, but pertains to two aspects: 1) Professional software dev experience, 2) Personal life experience. BBI was my first full-time job and it has a major impact on my life/lifestyle. And working in two different teams, one working under Microsoft designers, and one working with our own designers, are very different experiences.

The culture of the team is really shaped by the leader(s). The more senior managers seems to be less enthusiatic, while dedicated project managers (who are not technical people) tends to care about the project progress on a more humane level.

The last and first day I actually went to the studio physically was a bless, though nowadays looking back, that makes me slightly regret as an introvert and less experienced individual not being able to fully embrace the collaborative working environment and making more long-lasting friends with the diverse personalities.

## Studio Location

Since parking was very difficult and I don't see obvious ways to take bus to work, the studio location is not impressive. But the interior designs and styles are pretty good.

The seats at designer area have intentionally atmospheric lighting - although I heard this is bad for long-time work because ample lighting is preferred.

## Team Culture Experience

The first team I worked with was rather dull - people rarely talk, chat or tell jokes. The leader seems not that interested in participating in smaller activities.

The second team was larger and all in-house, and culture-wise more vibrant. A lot of cool people. Like, really cool.

## Professional Experience

Both projects used the same larger underlying codebase (Bedrock), and both uses Azure as DevOp platform - it was a bit confusing at first but generally very good.

The first team assigns tasks with units measure as days, the second team uses hours. Turns out the second approach was more reasonable.

Talking with designers from Microsoft from the first team was difficult, latter I learnt to shut up and don't give my opinions. The second team's designers, however, are slightly more interested in asking for technical opinions. In general, if the intention was for graphical designers to work without technical limitations and be less concerned with non-creative suggestions, then blocking communication might seem a viable approach - however, even in that case, open communication should always be the key for better decision making, unless the capacity of communication is the real issue.

## Project Experience

(Talk about specific projects on what I can talk about in more technical details)

### Some Mobile Development (Touchscreen)

### Minecraft Legend

(PENDING)

### Summary of Techniques and Tool Stack

Using Azure for DevOp is great way to management project progress and tasks - however it does seem VERY essential to have a dedicated project manager (someone non-technical) just for managing those tasks. Because tasks documentation, linking, and status updates all requires efforts and book-keeping.

I used C++ extensively, it's very pleasant to say that the code quality is top-notch. One thing I learnt and rather surprisingly, is that one should reduce unnecessary comments as many as possible, and code clarity and simplicity is more important than "efficiency" or "coolness", and that good readable codes follow very well-established design patterns and framework patterns.

For instance, for finger hold and touch animation for some progress bar I once proposed an equation that provides slightly tempered fade-off at both ends but my manager prefers a simple linear interpolation which I agrees it's better. As to well-established design patterns, I think the most notable ones are using functional, components, MVC, state machine, and good code organization.

## Large Corporation Level Comments

The first original title (Shipwrecker) doesn't impress me in terms of gameplay, but I do like pretty much everything behind the scene. Also it's a bit hard to tell how upper levels decide on which games to make (for original titles) for communication on that channel seems not super transparent/open.

We have something like hack-day or innovation/idea days (forget the name). That's 3-4 days long period and one can propose and plan ideas before hand. My communication in that regard wasn't successful - mostly because as a beginner I tend to think too big and not able to realistically scale down. One thing surprise me is that "the ideas that the company doesn't take belongs back to the proposer", which was a bit counterintuitive - shouldn't it be obvious/always true?

The most unique experience and something I absolutely love about this 200-300 people organization is the monthly meetings, where senior executives share financial and operational reports, and each production team shares latest progress. That's just informative and inspiring.
