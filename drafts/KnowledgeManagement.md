# Knowledge and Asset Management Software

Anyone who ever dared to collect and categorize all the multimedia files or knowledge must have faced the same dilemma, and those who attempt to developed "externalized memory" will find the challenge especially difficult. On the other hand, sometimes it's useful to keep stuff in memory - but that only applies to the most trivial information that doesn't concern details.

There are lots of similarities between knowledge management and asset management, but we will talk about each one separately then talk about their common features.

Knowledge management:

1. Context - surrounding information
2. Tags/Keywords/Searchable
3. Categories
4. Timing

Asset management:

1. Type (Software, format)
2. Notes
3. Tags, categories
4. Timing
5. Other metrics (duration etc.)

Here I highlight the most important demands from knowledge and asset management perspective:

1. Tagging is sometimes not important but can be highly useful, on the other hand, is searching is possible, it's equivalent to a full text search
2. Clue or sequential categorization is most effective

One major different between textual knowledge and multimedia file is the former can be managed inside a single MD file while the latter must be done as separate files. A challenge with existing FS is you cannot easily tag files or adding additional notes.

As a prelude/conclusion, the recommended workflow so far is:

1. Due to limits of existing formats and tools, the problem is better divided into Resources, Assets, Creations, Texts, and Multimedia management
2. I no longer manage things that are not created by me or are not of asset grade, e.g. music and videos
3. Try keep notes in MD as much as possible, and avoid all non-textual annotations
4. It's not wise to try to develop new custom formats for multimedia tagging

Some absolutely shitty and useless (or barely functional) solutions:

* YouTube playlist is garbage (but its searching is good, so honestly YouTube doesn't need it)
