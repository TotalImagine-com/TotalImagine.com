(PENDING AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK)

In this single-page article I provide a high-level review plus low-level pointers to various digital assets and creative tools I have for a centralized reference. It does not include tools still in survey. Everything here is solid choice after many reviews and hands-on practice. I had an idea of making a comprehensive view (either as website or single-file viewer) for all such data, but due to inhomogeneity of sources and technical challenges it's going to be a waste of time, so let's dont bother and use the simplest way that works.

<!-- Compile and share our CG dated note on survey of assets, produce viewable images and maybe just record YouTube videos for quick memo -->

## Overview

Main DCC Tools:

|Software|Domain|Comment|
|-|-|-|
|Blender|3D, 2D, Modeling, Animation, Compositing, Simulation, Motion Graphics|❤️Go-to for majority of 3D DCC work. Not suited for story boarding due to complexity. Works on laptop environment well.|
|Reallusion Character Creator|3D, Character Modeling|ONLY good but is really good for generic characters.|
|Reallusion iClone|3D, Animation|ONLY good but is really good for CC character animations.|
|Houdini|3D, VFX|❤️|
|Rhino (wo Grasshopper)|3D, Parametric Modeling|Investigating|
|Rhino (Grasshopper)|3D, Parametric Modeling|Investigating|
|TerraGen|3D, Landscape|So far haven't found any practical use in production due to its asset management limits; Pending exploitation. Still looks promising.|
|World Machine|3D, Landscape|Use with highly planned locations. Useful in specific shots.|
|NVIDIA Omniverse|3D, Animation, Physics, Presentation|Useless, don't bother.|
|Affinity Suites|2D|Good for general editing. Faster than Photoshop for basic stuff, not usable for painting.|
|QGIS|2D, Mapping|Mapping and lcation-based note-taking; So far mostly for concept work, not fully utilizing its map making capabilities yet.|
|Autodesk Sketchbook|2D|Good, fast and immersive for concept sketch. Requires drawing tablet.|
|Photoshop|2D|Good for detailed editing and digital painting. The AI content generation function is ok but not great.|
|~~iFX Clarisse~~|3D, Layout, #Dead|Dead.|

Major Asset Platforms (licensed):

|Platform|Type|Comment|Link|
|-|-|-|-|
|Unreal Marketplace|3D, Material, Shader, Asset, Environment, Template, #Purchased|Pending detailed review; Mostly are COMPLETELY NOT USABLE WITHOUT MAJOR EFFORT; MOSTLY CANNOT BLEND WELL WITH EACH OTHER FOR GAME PURPOSE; Well suited for quick and dirty animation making if our intended art style matches the asset; Specific assets can be useful across projects and that's why we need to review it thoroughly. Recommend DO NOT ATTEMPT TO fully catalog every asset or convert to USD because that's too much effort wasted in management|https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/vault|
|NVIDIA Omniverse|3D, Animation, Physics, Presentation, #Free|The software is useless, but the content library is VERY GOOD and quite extensive and easily reusable; Pending detailed survey.|
|Envato Elements|2D, Animation, Photo, Music, Sound Effect, #Subscribed, #Good|Good for serious use and production work; The problem right now is we don't have much time for production work.|
|Reallusion ActorCore|Animation|Suited only for CC characters?|-|
|Blender Demos|Scene, Model, Animation, VFX|A lot of high quality good stuff pending exploitatio.|https://www.blender.org/download/demo-files/|
|Kitbash 3D|-|-|-|
|MegaScan|-|-|-|
|XFrog 3000 Full|-|-|http://xfrog.com/product/XB-59.html|
|TwinMotion (Edu)|Assets|-|N/A (must view in-app)|
